1,okay so maybe i got it wrong i got a scooter and went to the ceking rice terraces in tegallalang there was a sign there was a man selling entry tickets maybe that should have been a warning and yes with careful positioning you could just about get a picture with rice terraces that did not have a restaurant on it or a shop or a swing  but the character and sense of space and lush green was to my mind spoilt by total over development now i am going to try again someone i spoke to today said he had found beautiful terraces so they are there just dont go to this commercial bit unless thats what you want if you do end up here you get a better sense of something if you climb down then back up and over the first ridge even there there is holliwood style lettering on one of the little walls of the paddies,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam,0,0,0,1,0
1,this is a commercial place we wanted to peacefully spend  hours in nature but rather we found someone every  feet along our path selling something to us rides donation etc the rice terrace is not as big as jatiluwih my recommendation would be to skip this place and spend a couple of hours at jatiluwih which is an unesco heritage site,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam,0,1,0,0,0
1,after doing a lot of research into the best rice terrace walk i was really looking forward to visiting here big mistake this place is like disneyland so fake and a total tourist attraction yes its pretty but purpose built not natural at all if you want a taste of the real thing take a drive into ubud and take a walk through the more peaceful remote and real rice terraces its called kajeng rice fields walk,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam,0,0,0,1,0
2,while in bali we knew we wanted to see an authentic rice terrace as they are so beautiful and also experience a jungle swing as it looked fun both popular things to do in ubud i had wanted to go to a wellreviewed rice field quite far from ubud but with our limited time i gave in and we went to tegalalang i should have gone with my guttegalalang was such a disappointment the rice field worker mannequins and the flowy dresses for rent when swinging were so disney and such a huge turnoffthere are several types of swings and we did in fact pay  to swing  swing ride it was nice but very uncomfortable afterwards we started walking in the fields thinking it would be peaceful and scenic but it was so contrived that we turned aroundwe really wish wed gotten better guidance from our guide and insisted on going to the farther less commercial rice terrace our mistake for sure worse a few hours later we visited gunung kawi and found they had a swing there too this one looked much more to our liking and much less touristed wish we had done thatthis was definitely not the right style for us maybe it will be better for you,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam,0,0,0,1,0
2,this place was not what i expected there are no real rice fields left its just for a photo opportunity its been competely expolited for tourists and you dont get the real feel for bali we asked our driver to take us to see rice fields but not the ones with the swings he took us there anyway was not worth the time or effort very disappointing unless all you are interested in is a photo,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam,0,0,0,1,0
2,only worth it if you want the staged photos you can make only one prearranged rice stop or you want to hit bali pulina plantation really as you approach you already get the touts trying to wave you in to their pay parking keep going till you see an open spot your next battle is the guys trying to charge entrance fee pick the entrance you can battle into or one with a cafe and argue that youre going to get something in there its a small amount but its a scam  if you dont want to do the photos or swing i think theres only one more donation spot for other farmers property and hes fine if you just put like k in we stopped for a drink at the ladies cafe on the opposite side and they let us use the toilet for free since we bought something the steps arent really all that breathtaking or exciting in my opinion unless you dont have time to see any other rice fields there are at least  you can walk to in downtown ubud,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam,0,1,0,1,0

3,the rice fields are beautiful to walk through but there are so many tourists now who are mostly just there for their instagram posts its so sad to see and theres a lot of disrespect for the land and the people in the pursuit of something instagramworthyin some reviews people talk about not paying donations youre walking through land where people are trying to make a living and the donation is a tiny amount in most currencies so make your own decisionas for the people who say the fields are not longer farmed well youre wrong and if you stayed for more than  mins and or talked to the people who live here youd find that out and learn a lot more,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam,0,2,3,3,1
3,on retrospect being charged an entrance fee to enter a rice terrace was probably the first indication this was a bit of a tourist trap although im sure this once served as a culturally pure agricultural exercise it seems the main harvest these days is coming in on two legs its equipped with most of your stable instagram requirements like the jungle swings and locals holding the basketsthe rice terraces themselves are actually quite nice to look at but there are just so many hoardes of tourists it really takes away from the experiencei think if you want to view rice terraces youre better off going to jatiluwah,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam,0,1,0,3,1

1,its a sunrise on a wayyyy over crowded mountain with cash grabs all along the waydefinitely do another hike if you canthe use of a guide is recently mandatory as wellone positive is that it is a good view of a sunset if you are lucky and monkeys come out at the top to grab food,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,1,3,0
1,mt batur and the lake are very beautiful thats the only positive thing i could say about that place if you want to climb the volcano crater without a guide the locals will stop you and they are not very friendly there is no official entrance fee insurance and any obligation to go with a paid guide this mountain is taken over by a bunch of local criminals rude and aggressive who dont allow visitors to climb on their own without paying a lot of money and probably everyone who pays for a local guide supports that mafia there is no such thing as licensed guide there its surprising how that popular and really beautiful place in bali is under control of unfriendly locals with no any governmental regulations pay or go away and as a result no chance for budget travelers who cant afford paying big amount of money to go there there is no fixed price its all about negotiating and bargaining is that the the official and legal way to climb the mountainonce in the village one will be followed and asked many personal questions will be subject to disturbing bothering offered to buy something or help its not help its just overpriced service so if you decide to go there please be wellinformed and take your decision consciously and wisepersonally i would not advice people on going there unless that unfair and illegal business is regulated by the government or legal institution,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,1,3,0
1,i booked my tour on viator for the sunrise trek through the local como bali tour company they are nothing more than a bunch of thieves who care absolutely nothing about you or your safetyi got picked up at my hotel at am and taken to a filthy restaurant for fly infested pancakes and black coffee dont even think about using the bathrooms as i almost vomited from how disgusting they werethen the rain started pouring they charge you  idr to rent a coat and another  idr for a poncho the rain was so bad along with the lightening and thunder that i decided not to go they insisted it was safe and that it wasnt slippery and there was no thunder but thankfully im not blind or deaf and could see they would say anything to you so you would do the treki refused i then got price gouged to take the same taxi that drove me there back to my hotel which was more expensive than the actual tour itselfdont do it they look at foreigners as nothing more than dollar signs and so not care about you your safety or your experience,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,1,1,0,1,0
1,our  friends decided to try and go see the sunrise but when we arrived there on our bikes a group of guides who are nothing more than rude pushers charged us usd per person for a guide that is not even needed we founded a bit pricey for a walk of  hours and decided to inquire more  there are no prices  receipts or rules when you get there  the ticketing office has no information and after we very politely tried to decline their guidance they became aggressive and physical we tried asking if we could pay a ticket but decline the guide and this was met with another tens of people surrounding us and yelling  go away and shut up   to which is possibly the most discouraging that can be said after getting pushed and them trying to take away our motorbike keys  we did not use one curse word or raised our voice once yet the treatment was the same  no police or official to lodge the complaint either so we protested the best way we could and refused the whole thing and not giving this people one cent if you want to do this i highly recommend you dont until they get this stupidity sorted  we are more than willing to pay an entrance price but this shows to the lack of creativity of the locals and the corruption by the police and tourism ministry to allow this to happen right in front of them as they get paid too by the guides to look the other way  avoid at all costs yall  it truly ruined our trip there and most defiantly we wont ever be coming back  bali  wake up  unionize your guides charge a ticket  like any other place  and split the money amongst the local if you so desire  but getting harassed pushed and almost beaten up by  people for trying to go up a trail is not a sustainable business practice strong words that i cant type fyou guides youre rude and dishonest  take your money elsewhere the sun raises regardless,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,0,1,0
1,do not support the mountain mafiawe decided as a group to take a taxi to the volcano and do the easy trekking by ourselves as previous comments reveal  not possible due to the mountain mafiawe got harrased verbally and physially abused by the ignorant inbreed mountain mafia portraying to work for the government pushing around women half their size and yelling at their faces discustingthey had even a selfprinted government padge that they showed for  second before hiding it i asked to have a closer look to check the details and ofcourse i could not do that without aggressive shouting about me disrespecting their country wow was able to see that it was definately something made in the next door garageyou can go to the mountain by purchasing a over priced tour i would not recommend anyone supporting this mafia activity you should not have to pay for a sunriseps pictures are taken from the village next to mt batur as beautiful sunrise no mafia,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,1,0,0

1,i climbed mount batur today from  am with my boyfriend and a guide the guide costed k rupies each after negotiation it was recommemded by our driver i would not recommend to climb the volcano because you are obliged to climb with a guide that you have to pay a lot and provide you with no service our guide did not explain anything and was not interested at all in our safety i often go trekking and i was wearing trekking shoes for me the descent was very very slippery you need to take your time go very slowly and wear trekking shoesi would recommend to climb mount batur only with a professionale guide that deserves the pay or to go alone if you are good trekkerslandscape from mount batur is beautiful but the environment is full of litter,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,1,0,0
1,nothing to say about the view that is very nicewe did the day climbing arriving there at am once arrived they charged us k rupies after negotiation only k saved more than  eur per person and giving us a very young guide that didnt know english and could not explain anything about the trip but just indicating the road that was already very clear the mountain itself was not too bad but full of litters and garbages all around that in my opinion ruined the experience in italy such shameful ruined environment was not possible to find anywherethe question is  what you are offering with  euro  nothing and its a shame the guide was literally running and during the descent was hard to follow her such that my girlfilrfend falled down and hurt herself  the track si very slipperyplease avoid wasting money and fueling this shameful experience its a theft robbery organized by local and no respectful peoplehoping that some people will use brain and not giving  stars just for a good foto on instagram because this is not tourism its just being stupid and cheated the max i can do is giving  stars with the hope that someone will read this and understandplease stay away,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,1,1,1,3,0
1,had the complete sunrise trekking tour in midaugust  with my familythis is hell on earth or something that closely resembles itno need to describe what the tour is about because this is widely dealt with in any travel guide and there are countless feeds on tripadvisor and countless social media about the experiencei think this is something to avoid at all costs for the following reasons there are thousands of people ascending the mountain every night you literally walk in a row from the beginning to the top no privacy no sensation of doing something in the wilderness it feels like being on the london underground on a busy weekday at am you are just packed like a sardine in an endless column you do not see the surroundings when you go up because it is night and dark but when you descend in the daylight you are stunned by the sorry state of mount batur debris dispersed everywhere plastic and the inevitable traces of the passage of thousands of careless tourists every day my environmental spirit was disgusted at the scenery surrounding me it looked like a calcutta slum all the way up every  seconds or so for a solid hour and a half of ascent and then on the subsequent way down you are forced to step aside the trail to let pass the socalled mototaxis which are old and gas guzzling trial motorcycles or the cheap indonesian version of it ferrying lazy passengers to the top the noise the pollution the risk of being run over by these criminals is so high that it makes the entire trail look like a modern version of dantes infernolas but not least there is no chance that the sun will eventually break into the heavy clouds and the thick cold and humid fog that surrounds the mountain topthe day we did it aug th  there was nothing but a thick fog which prevented us from seeing anywhere beyond  metres ahead of us until we were back down at the starting point exhausted and frustratedin a word you wake up at am you travel long distances to reach the strarting point and then you leave for a few hours of sorrow for which you have to pay an exhorbitant price just to be literally gassed by a gang of criminals and you can barely speak to your companions as you are enlisted in a mile long row of slaves ascending the mountaincrazy,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,1,1,1
1,we were really looking forward to this hike as we love spending time in nature and we frequently do sunrise hikes back home too so we thought okay why not in bali might be a bit crowded but we are only here once so lets do thiswell we should have thought twice and read the bad reviews closely and taken them more seriously this was the most horrible experience ever there were literally thousands not hundreds of people you hsd to queue to take your next step guides were literlly carrying unfit visitors up the mountain there were human excrements everywhere to a point where it was just stinking on the way back down in the sun we can handle a lot but this exploitation of nature is just unbearable dont go if you wanna keep your sanity walking up and down and if you dont wanna start hating every single tourist on bali,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,1,0,1,1,1
1,this excursion is offered by many tour operators and hundreds take it every daythe mountain is lovely and the views are breathtaking but the excursion quality is very iffy and the way the unregulated mt batur guidestour operators behave like a mafia can make this a horrible experience i dont think it is worth it and it left a horrible taste in the mouth ruined our last day and half in baliwe used ubud sunrise trekking to do this and were ina group of total  people morning of th aug we did not summit at all a  km hike up and down in vain in the dark after waking at am and spending  idrthe queue of hikers was very long and once the hike started in earnest there was such a jam that in this tough terrain one moved one foot and then had to wait till the queue moved forward another foot due to the narrow track and the scree it was slow going in the dark we all had torches and not at all fun because of the sheer numbers the hike itself is also not easy and without the numbers one might enjoy that challenge  but even this was denied ussince the queue moved so slowly we didn reach the summit in time for the promised sunrise view we waited at a vantage point to see it well below the summitafter the sunrise though our guides didnt offer to take us upto the summit at all when we insisted they grumpily said ok but were not happy the group was being split amongst those going up and those not so ultimately we didnt climb up then we were whizzed down an easy track down the mountain to our van there was little time to enjoy the scenery in a lovely place or appreciate the views the annoyance stems from the fact that there is an easy track that motorcycles use you can pay to be taken up close to the summit  or down which is broad quite easy to walk but these tour operators do not take hikers up this track and insist on that traffic choked narrow hike that may not result in summittingthis easy path is a continuation of an asphalt road that you walk a long for a km or  from the van parking ground where hikers are made to turn left and climb a scree filled dirt track the asphalt road continues to the right before turning into a level and decent dirt track whcih we came down laterit seems that the tour operators collude with the bike riders in keeping the hikers off this easy track else few people would hire the bikers the guides who take you up the mountain do not guide  they speak little english tell you almost nothing about the mountain region or much of anything they do offer you help in the uphilldownhill should you need it which to be fair is really nice these guides are not part of the tour company but belong to an association that has a stranglehold and have to be usedthere are other lovely things to do in bali why exhaust yourself waste money on this pity that a gorgeous place and what could be a wonderful experience is ruined by the greed of the operators and guides,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,1,3,1
1,out hotel kamojang jimbaran arranged this trip for us we paid usd  for our trip transport guide breakfast we stayed in jimbaran and we were picked up at am the driver was almost half hour late only then were we told that we were picking up  other passengers before heading to the hiking starting point we had to squeeze in with larger size passengers not sure why we pay so much and be treated with no comfortwhen we arrived at the hiking point our driver showed us to our guide who was going to guide all  of us we started our ascent with the guide walking in front of the lot of us half and hour from the start i needed a break so i stopped my friend stopped along but the guide did not see me stop so they continued we then continued to climb and found our group waiting we continued to gather again and i needed a short break once again when the group continued again in the end we had to climb by ourselves and were surrounded by new guide they expected us to pay them who wanted to take us to the top since our paid guide did not wait for us we said no and continued hiking we reached the top way before sunrise so we didnt understand why they rushed up without enjoying the scenery and the starsthe guide told us to come u standing at the top without telling us which path to use which caused me to fall and scratch my palms because of the distractionwe were made to sit and wait for sunrise and were only served plain bread and steamed egg we had to crack the shell ourselves with dirty handswe asked the guide if we were going up to the crater he said yes after sunrise but only took us to the crater at the level below and did not bring us up to the highest point it was a disappointmentwe then began decent and we were left to trail behind once again by the guide who walked up front and didi not check on the people behind it became worse when other groups walked fast in front of us and got into the queue which made us behind even more we keep walking down ourselves and it was hard the stone was slippery we carefully made our way down and found the group down at the level path the guide did not do anything in helping us decent he had poor skills to guide peoplehe only decided to walk with us once we reached the bottom and had  km to the gatesas we understand mt batur can only be hiked with guides but what happens if our guide leaves usour guides name was nadi and he is not fit to guide did not deserve any penny we paid,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,1,0,0
1,having read online that you do not need a guide to trek up to mount batur i decided save some cash and drive  walk up it myself however when i arrived at the trail entrance around  i was immediately stopped by a group of locals posing as guides at a gate and told i would have to pay  rupee for a guide and that it wasnt possible to do it on my own knowing that they were trying to scam me i attempted to just push past but they grabbed my backpack and surrounded me with no way past as i wasnt going to fight a group of locals i attempted to skirt around the outside of the entrance however they patrolled the area and caught me and began calling me a terrorist and many other things eventually it escalated to death threats when i ignored them and kept climbing at which point i left just thought id give a warning to any solo travellers,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,1,0,0
1,we drove there by ourselves in the middle of the night its a mountain on no mans land so no trekking guide should be permittedwe were followedtraced and forced by a lot of locals who were trying to sell their trekking guide tours to us not interested then they told us that they hate tourists like us just because we dont wanna spend money on their horrible trekking rip off dealsafter we went to the foot of the mountain our lives were threathenes by a group of so called guides they keep kicking and punching us from behind even though we were running away after that we finaly got back to our bikes and we got ambushed even more by the locals this was a horrible experience and i sure hope no one will ever go there to spend their money on this horrible balinese sharade,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,1,0,1
1,watch out for locals trying to scam your money we went for a late morning trek to avoid the sunrise crowd got stopped along the way by a local with an expired  tour guide license claiming that we had to pay k idr to go up the mountain outrageous to try and scam tourists and ruin peoples experience of bali i understand life as a local might be challenging but its all about money money money for these people we ended up driving to a more legitimate agency and the guide brought us up and left us to find our way out at the bottom of the mountain agree with the below comment not a good experience and not worth the hassle,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,1,0,0
1,we tried to find out how to do it without a guide because its quite an expense for just  hours of hike around  thats when the word mafia started to appear some people had really bad experience because of that and in the end we did like most people do booking a tour with a guide including a breakfast at the top with hot drinkwe woke up at  am i was worried about the cold since i dont have any warm clothes when i mentioned my concern to the office girl and asked if i could borrow a jacket she told me that my thin sweater would be more than enough and i understand now why she told me that because as soon as we started locals were trying to sell us jackets of course its better if i payas we reached the first stop i witnessed an altercation between  indonesian guides and a tourist the latter was walking alone on the path and apparently one of the guide hit him with his motorbike the three guides stood against the tourist accusing him of injuring their friend the tourist tried to explain himself  to no avail  and showed them that he was injured on the leg too he got kicked in this leg twice by one of the guide that was obviously furious against him the tourist got kicked out of the entrancei highly suspect that this guy didnt take any guide and locals will never let you pass without one even if it means using verbal and physical abuse i was shocked i started to understand the word mafia actually you pay for a guide not because the path is dangerous and difficult but because the locals are dangerous for you if you dont take onepatrols of locals were passing everywhere surveying people alone after reading some reviews after my experience i realised that it can go very far some tourists being threatened to be killed if they didnt pay for a guide and its not just about the guides all the locals are involved in this business and if you are seen alone youll get pursued all the way and threatened until you either go back home or pay there is no way out if you want to go if you just want to walk up a simple mountain its definitely not normal it really is a mafia i regret my choice because by paying i allowed this sick business to go onand the hike is easy one path crowded by guides ours was useless and made the trip very annoying because you cant go at your own pace the guy would wait everytime for the slowest to follow very annoying for the fastest very pressuring for the slowestthen can we talk about the fact that this volcano is indeed on the unesco list and you cross path with tons of motorbikes on the trail how good for the environment is that and not to mention the fact that we are hiking and have to endure the smell of fuel all the way up also having to stop to let them pass because they drive without caring about hikers and on top of that they dare sometimes stop and ask people if they need a ride to climb not free we are hikingarriving on top we discover our breakfast  pieces of plain toast  egg  banana when i asked about the coffee they offered they told me i have to pay for it of course its definitely freezing out there and a hot beverage is so tempting that most of the people cant resist and pay for it anywaythe sunrise is beautiful but honestly you can admire sunrises everywhere where its free where the site is well maintained and where there are no threats of being killed if you dont pay for a useless guidei asked to the guide if its on the unesco list how can motorbikes work herethe guide felt ill at ease and tried to avoid it by replying something like the motorbikes take the weakest person to the top its only twenty minutes drivei had no pleasure in climbing that volcano i participated into an horrible business where tourists are used as money spitters i am surprised to see so many good reviews about thispeople pay but nobody knows where your money is going and what for since the area doesnt look taken care of i repeat its just a sick business,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,1,0,0
1,this is by far the worst experience in bali also the worst hiking experience i ever hadif you read some reviews youll soon discover that you apparently need a guide to hike the mount batur we a group of three dont like to hike with a guide so i tried to figure out if we could do it without the reviews we read were not really reassuring mentioning a local mafia by need a guide what they mean is that they will not only verbally but also physically threaten you if you dont have one unfortunately we ended up booking one and i can say that i completely regret it to participate in this sick businessas we were hiking we stopped at a first station to rest there a guy didnt have a guide a motorbike crashed him on the way and both of them were injured this injured tourist tried to defend himself saying he was just walking and showed he was hurt to one of the guides and this guide kicked him in the injured leg twice it was extremely shocking then they took him to the beginning of the trackas you may have noticed i wrote motorbike apparently there are different tracks but on the one we were it was full of motorbikes on a unesco site so when your lungs are fully open youre gonna smell fuel not to mention that the paths are narrow so youll have to stop to let them pass they will also stop to ask you if you want a taxi we are hikingwe were a group of  with people we dont know and the guide waits for everyone so you cant have your own pace whether youre slow or fasta breakfast is provided for the top of the mountain which is a joke   slices of bread one boiled egg and a banana no hot beverage whereas we were told so but of course you have to pay for itlast but not least a guide is completely useless as theres no difficulty in this trek the path is completely noticeable and full of tourists with flashlight anyway so you just have to follow and if you take your time its far from being hard moreover at one point we got separated with our group so it was only me and the guide so anything could have happened to the rest of themeven if its one of the main attraction on bali please please do not participate in this disastrous hike its not profitable for anyone the sunrise might be pretty on the top sure but i really couldnt enjoy it and youll see as pretty sunrise anywhere else try to get your sunrise for free somewhere else youll do not only yourself a favour but also everyone,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,1,1,0

1,mount batur is a renowned hiking place and is popular for sunrise this is by far the biggest tourist trap and the price range for hiking is as low as   ruppiah to as high as   ruppiah depending on how would like to get cheated a local person briefed me about this tourist trap and how the mountain mafia doesnt allow the tourists to be on their own i enjoyed the views and the sunset from a distance,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,0,3,0
1,do not go if you want to go without a guide we a group of three wanted to go up mt batur we went there on our own and tried to go up the mountain however as soon as we tried we were blocked in doing so by  men surrounding us they said that we had to pay   for the guide  pp entrance we refused to pay for a guide and tried to go again on our own at which point one of us got tackled and the others got pushed by the men after that we went away but we were followed by the guys on their scooters every time we stopped they also stopped and threatened us not to go up on our own to conclude if you want to go up mt batur please inform yourself about the possibilities at a place you trust,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,1,0,0
1,we went there with my husband this morning we arrived around am and decided to hike by ourselves as it is an easy trek as we were almost at the top of the volcano a guide with a motorbike asked us if we had a guide we answered no and told him that it is ok we do not need one he started to be very angry and aggressive then he jumped on his motorbike and rode on me and my husband trying to make us fall into the ravine after he stopped  meters away waiting for us and screaming so with my husband we decided to climb off road to be safe he waited min and as he did not see us he went back on his path and then stopped again waiting for us finally after  min he was still waiting for us we were sitting off road on the mountain waiting for him to leave as we were afraid and he started to threaten us he screamed twice you will die in the forest we finally found a group to go down of the mountain but their guide was laughing when we told him the story when we arrived in the forest we paid  guys to bring us back to our motorbike they were aggressive till we paid themso to conclude the mountain is nice but we had the worst experience ever we never faced this issue before in bali guides are useless as the treck is easy but they just want to take your money and if you resist they are very very aggressive,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,0,3,0
1,wed heard so much about how great batur was so we were willing to do the am start the experience was a total let down though and we regretted goingissuesstart time after being picked up at am we stopped on the way to batur for breakfast which was a kind of crepe while being fed can be nice we all would have preferred an extra half hour of sleep over thisits not really a traditional hike getting to the top does require going vertical but it doesnt feel like a hike as you approach the mountains base you can see a steady stream of headlamps leading all the way to top the entire way up youre essentially in a line taking a step when the person in front of you does as well that being said part of the reason that its so slow is that tons of people come in totally inadequate clothing youre going over volcanic soil you need real shoesthe guide doesnt offer anything youre required to hire a guide to go up batur due to the above point the guide does play any role in navigating you up the mountain ours was actually out of shape and kept requesting breaks on the way up we didnt get any information about the mountain or its importance from our guide either on the way down which is a less intuitive path our guide actually ran ahead of us out of sightbreakfast on top of the mountain though youve already stopped for a  am crepe youre promised breakfast on top of the mountain too when we got to the top our guide instructed us to take a seat and said he would be back with our food  minutes later he returned with breakfast two untoasted pieces of white bread and a hard boiled egg from members of the group who had gone searching for him we learned that he and other guides had spent that time sitting in a shack with a heaterthere is no guarantee of a view this bit was expected no person controls the weather and higher altitudes are certainly subject to more cloud cover than the beaches the clouds did not break one bit for us but again we knew that was a possibility if we had understood the overall negatives of the tour as a whole we wouldnt have make the trip knowing that a sunrise was not for sureit is wayyyy overpriced not just overpriced by bali standards  usd would have been too much to pay for that experience in the usits hard to get the most out of the rest of the day we got back and were super tired from the early morning much of that day became a lost causepositive there are some monkeys that you can see on the way down,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,1,1,0
2,we went today to mt batung sunrise along with perhaps other ca  tourists the sun rise is beautiful which is why i am giving  stars and not  the impression is totally destroyed by way too many people going one by one on the narrow path in dust dust mask would have helped even worse when going down as there is no chance to pass the crowd so for the  minutes of beautiful scenery several hours of horror maybe great for people who dont mind crowds loud music on the way and cheerful screaming of the crowd when the sun rises not for me tough who enjoys more authentic experiences,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,0,3,1
2,very crowded and a challenging trekwe started off meeting our tour guide she was lovely and helped us all the way throughwhen you get to the top the views are amazing there are hundreds of people trying to get to the top its chaos  pitch black at the beginning with only a torch to guide youthe last  of the way was very challenging it was very steep we wore acceptable footwear toowhen we got to the top we were taken aback with peoples rudeness of just standing in front of us there is a lot of space at the top to sit down and enjoy the view there really is no need to stand in other peoples waythe way down was also toughthere is no preparation at the beginning either no safety talk etc just meet your guide and off you goim glad that we done this trek but i wouldnt do it again  not sure i would recommend to anyone either,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,1,0,1
2,we booked the trip as a group of  who all have a high fitness level we managed it but there was no advice on the physical demands that are expected and the route down was quite challengingwe also thought it would be a handful of groups going up the mountain at am instead we was faced with thousands of others and was in a queue from the bottom all the way up the top with a one person track breakfast was also a bit of a let down two sliced of plain bread and a boiled egg given at the start to carry up with youthe views were amazing but it wasnt worth the crowds,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,1,1,1
2,yes it is a spectacular view if you can get to see it with all the aggressive sellershawkers up there it cost to get there then it cost to go up the volcano and it just keeps on costing if you are on a budget be careful the drive around the volcano and lake was well worth it oh yeah and they charge to use the toilet and make sure you bring your own paper the drive up the range to get to mount batur you will find plenty of monkey roaming freely and their are places where you can park,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,0,0,0
2,at first we thought it should be a nice trekking tour to the vulkane batur but it wasntwhen you decide to make the tour you need a dust mask it was so dusty more than  peoples goes the small path up to the mountain so you stand walk stand walk and also motor cross bikes are driven on the small pathwhen you catch the top you must have luck to see the sunrise i recommend to check the weather forecast before you start and bring with you good shoes warm clothes and a flashlight,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,1,0,1,0,1
2,my husband and i went on this trek which was stated as slightly challenging but since we are ok in terms of fitness we booked it we were also going to the hot springs afterwardswe booked it with gyg and when we got there it was pitch black and we were given torches there was a squat hole toilet at that point but thats it we walked through farmers fields and it started off ok however after a short while it became very sandy and gravelly and was very difficult to walk at that point the slope of the hill started to increase to eventually a  degree angle for  hours of the  hour hike i would say and this was a mixture of sand which was very hard to walk on never mind climb and rock climbing where i felt sometimes i was going to fall backwards the view at the place we stopped that was of the sunrise was amazing i have to say it was breathtaking the descent was also breathtaking but for very different reasons imagine trying to descend  degree slopes made entirely of sand and gravel i fell twice and cut myself and twisted my knee and the guide did nothing and didnt show any concern at all by the time we got down we were incredibly exhausted traumatised from the ordeal of walking down and up  even though we couldnt get to the summit so much so that we couldnt face going to the hot springs we just wanted a shower back at our hotel and to collect our thoughts after researching this i found out the main route the tourists are supposed to take is a simple hike with a flat area half way with a coffee shop etc this made me so mad because it was what i was looking forward to the most on our honeymoon  hours away from home and the experience was ruined because whichever company gyg chose took us up the wrong wayif you want a very challenging hike go the back way however if you want to make it up there to the top and see the view the main tourist way is best,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,1,3,0
2,this is a huge tourist trap we went on a tour as it seems to be impossible without one due to the mafia the walk up was not too hard it is a straight forward path however a few generally unfitsmokers did struggle the walk however was hugely ruined by the amount of people you are head to toe with the person in front everyone has to go at the same speed as there are so many people the guide said about  people do it everyday it is ridiculous at the top the view was average especially for indonesia we have seen far better sights the breakfast was not as described no cooking food in volcanoes etc just some eggs banana and bread its also horrific going back as all the tourists go at once it takes forever to get back to ubud ijenbromoberastagi are far better dont waste your money and support the mafia guides,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,0,1,1
2,we climbed mount batur this morning and we have a very divided opinion about this experiencealready at home i read on the internet that it is practically impossible to climb the volcano without a guide because there is a kind of a guide mafia since we didnt want any problems we booked a tour on the mount batur with a guide for  dollars per person on the internetat  am a very nice driver picked us up punctually in ubud afterwards we were taken to a kind of office where several people offered jackets and sweaters actually we didnt want to support this but since i didnt have the right clothes i decided for a jacket on the summit i was very happy about it because it is really cold and windy renting the jacket costed  ird around  dollars in the office we got to know our guide quickly after we started to hike we noticed that it is not a comfortable natureloving hike as we expected because there are dozens of motorcyclists who want to turn a taxi upwards not only do you have to step on your side all the time the motorcycles cause terrible air the riders transport you almost to the top so that you only have to walk about  minutes to the summit in fact there are some tourists who gratefully accept the offer completely incomprehensible this has nothing more to do with nature and hiking the crowds would not have disturbed us but these motorcycles leave us with a bitter aftertaste as far as we know there ist another way to the top where the motorbikes cant ride but that one is much more exhausting and almost the same length in timewhen we reached the top some people were already sitting on the benches the different guides probably have their fixed benches where their customers can sit our guide then brought us a hot drink and asked us to come and see how he makes eggs for us he put the eggs in the hole of the crater after  minutes the eggs were cooked and our breakfast was ready in addition to the eggs there was unroasted toast with banana pieces in betweenthe view on the volcano is beautiful for this view it is definitely worthwhile to climb the volcanohowever there is absolutely no guide necessary you can also find the way by yourself it is not dangerous we felt a little bit controlled by the guide it is a pity that this has developed in such a way that one cannot climb up without a guide,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,1,0,1
2,not a good area to be visited as we have to pay to cross the road to get to batur then we have to pay again to trek the mountain too much tourist and rubbish with the collection of money from the tourist the organizer doesnt pay attention to it,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,1,0,0,0,1
2,we set off from ubud at am arrived at the base of mt batur at am and began the hour long hike up the volcano i have medium fitness level and had to stop every  mins or so to recover it was very challenging to the point that i actually had an eib episode exercise induced brinchospasm thank god my husband had his asthma puffer on him the guide said very little to encourage us up the mountain and didnt even come to check on me as i was having the asthma attack to see if i was ok we eventually made it to the top where it was freezing cold we were in shorts and tshirts and had to sit for an hour waiting for the sun to rise while sprukers tried to sell you a loan of a blanket for  rupiah we were not told to bring warm clothes unfortunately the sunrise was hidden by clouds on our trip and the  of us were desperate to get down the mountain out of the cold so we asked our guide to lead us down not long after the sunrise the guide held my hand the whole way down which was very helpful as the loose gravel is very slippery in fact everyone of us took a tumble on the way down ending up with scratches and scrapes as we had walked up in darkness with flashlights we had no idea where we had actually walked when the sun rose and we saw the trek we had just done we were pretty horrified at some points we were trekking right on the edge of the volcano and a slight stumble or wrong footing could have easily seen one of us fall over the edge i dont like being negative but i feel we were not adequately prepared for this trek in any way shape or form my husband is a very fit tradie and he did it no worries but for your average joe who walks a few times a week or bike rides this was a very challenging venture im glad i did it but i wouldnt do it again,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,1,1,0
3,we did this as part of our honeymoon and we couldnt end up with a better guidewe had a great experience on our hike with the fantastic guide karma hes careful safe and will to please a fantastic guy whos always on the lookout for your safetythe only negative experience which weve had was with the drier that picked us up from the hotel at  am from kuta beach because on the way to the mt he took a nap while driving not the best thing to witness so i made sure to ask him open answer questions this way he doesnt fall asleep againother than than the whole experience was beautiful and it is a must you have to make sure you are well equipped when doing itessentials light jacket it is freezy up and you will be sweaty in case you do not have one you could rent from them but it will be idk for it full pants and you could have shorts underneath torch  headlight but the guide will provide one for you anyways water because it is quite expensive on the mt understandable good shoes it is slippery and a high chance of fallingalso i would recommend having an extra shirt that you can change in above in case you do like your sleep it is recommended to leave for the tour from ubud rather than kutaall being said karma is the best guy ever and i suggest if you do this to ask for him hes well worth his pay and i would recommend tipping him at the end because hes not making much on thishave fun and stay safe,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,3,0,1,0
3,booked through a hostel when staying in ubud we were a group of back packer friendsthis walk was hard  we asked prior to booking and were told the hike was fairly easy admittedly we are not in tiptop shape but at the same time are fairly averagely healthy  year olds it was hard and it was not overly funthe safety especially when walking down was very questionable and many people had slipped when walking down the volcano the sunrise isnt that impressivethere are no toilets so make sure you go for the number two before you hike or else you will be very uncomfortable when hiking,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,1,1,0
3,just dont waste your time and energyit is really hard crowdy and overpricedbut the view is really goodthis is the only one thing that is good butnot by the cost of  hours climbing,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,1,0,1
3,some recommend a guided tour to climb the old volcano it is of course a more comfortable solution than doing it by yourself the tour prices vary from around  usd up to  usd what the tour companies provide is basically the same an early transportation in a minivan and a guided walk uphill some kind of breakfast and then back all this can be done much cheaper by renting a scooter for around  usd per day and driving it to the nearest point of the trail from ubud this takes  hours depending on the traffic at some point you might be stopped by some local people dressed in what looks like uniforms and asked for a pay of around  usd for a permit and insurance this is a scam just drive dont stop and try to argue with them because they have done the scam for years and are very convincing when you reach the village in the bottom of the large crater just follow the road to mount batur at a crossing you should turn left and follow a smaller paved road to a trekking point at this crossing you will be stopped by some local who demands another fee of around  usd per person for a permit and a guide they will most certainly point at a sign which claims that a guide is mandatory this is all fake just drive on if you stop and argue with this people the situation might get nasty and out of hands follow the road until it ends outside a hindu temple where you can park your scooter there is a larger park nearby but that park is crowded with the local guides who will scam you about paying money to the local hustlers some people consider this being aid to starving people to me it is just supporting corruption and paying money to gangsters in a dysfunctional country on the western side of the temple there is a trail uphill follow the trail when reaching a high point you will see a couple of empty buildings take a break and keep on following the trail eventually you will have walked round the crater and will be descending to the temple where you have parked your scooters about climbing the mountain it is not difficult and no mounting climbing experience is of course not needed it can be somewhat exhausting but by taking breaks it can be done by untrained people once on the edge the walk around the crater is easy no special shoes is needed we wore trainers sandals and even flip flops,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,1,0,0
3,so this is one of those must do hikes in bali and the views are wonderful on the way up and from the summit of mount baturbut the regular route is super crowded and motor bikes go up and down trying to convince trekkers to grab a lift the motorbike fumes are awful and this really makes for a terrible experienceonce you get to the top make sure you do the true summit which most people miss then traverse around the volcano and visit the two other craters which also provides an alternative descent route which we did without a single other person on the routethe alternate route is not for everyone and can be quite slippery and requires good foot workwe went super fast reaching the summit in  minutes and then had a relaxing traverse before having breakfast and then sauntering down to the start total round trip  hoursnote you are required to take a local guide which i did fortunately i had a young man who was up for a fast pace and was very happy to take the route less travelled,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,1,3,1
3,too crowded and risky trekking you cant back out in between path is extremely narrow and completely filled with ash and pebbles which makes it very difficult to climb good part is our guides were there with us for the whole trip and supported whenever required yes it is a rewarding expetience once you are at the top view from the top is mesmerizingoverall a mixed experience anybody with slightest doubt must avoid,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,1,0,1
3,my husband and i went on honeymoon to bali and being keen sunrise enthusiasts booked the above tour online with get your guide ahead of our travels paying  each was our first mistake as we came to learn that this was a heavily inflated package spruced up to sound a lot more luxurious than it turned out to bewe were collected on time from our accommodation outside ubud approx am joing  other guests in an unmarked car by a young man in very casual wear though i came to learn this is normal for easy going bali in hindsight i feel that a uniform and branded vehicle would have been more professional given we booked through a professional agent and for a professional and hefty price over an hour later we arrived to a small village afoot mt batur along with several other vehicles  many of which were branded get your guide odd we seemed to hover here indefinitely where we were each given a small bottle of water and headlamp though the straps were broken so these had to be hand held appreciated none the less as it was pitch black different clusters of guests were allocated to different guides some in uniform some not but mostly all in casual wear some guests got given walking sticks we werent offered the luxury of such but hey ho the toilet was horrendous a mere hole in the ground with no running water nor latch on the door being african im used to this scene  just not when ive forked out  for half a days excursionwe set off around am and were told we would be at the top within an hour baffled given the scale of the mountain i trusted our trained and experienced supposedly english speaking guide and marched along you could see there were already masses ascending the mountain from every angle and more at the top we trudged through local farmland scattered with litter and debris nice before the incline up loose volcanic rock and terrain began thank heavens i had packed my own l of water as our mini ml didnt touch sidesthe climb is tough going and gets steeper as you go along the guide respected the slowest of the groups pace moving aside to let the stream of trekking folk pass when need be a couple of people gave up at halfway an hour in so were left on the side of the mountain while we continued i did the math and this was clearly going to take longer than an hour  a shame as the skyline was already a hint of pinkjust when you wonder whether any health and safety precautions have been taken the summit is within reach  and its a race against the clock with the guide confirming  minute till sunrise we make it to the top just in time only for the novelty to be dampened by hundreds of other folk trawling the crater hawkers trying to sell you an overpriced worm coke and drones whizzing all over the placewe find a spot to enjoy the view and are thankful for the moderately clear skies the guides turn their hands to photography and get some great shots of their guests the view is honestly spectacular and well worth the calf killing climbbreakfast is served  a cold and tasteless egg sandwich some fruit and a questionable cup of coffee i appreciate we are at the top of a mountain and whilst im not expecting a hotel buffet im disappointed and try find the value in a steam cooked eggonce the novelty of sunrise has worn off trekkers queue for prized shots at the highest point amidst the steam and for the perfect instagram pic i just dont see the appeal really hustling atop a volcano and all thatwe commence our journey down which some find worse than the climb up the guides keep everyone in good spirits with their banter though as volcanic ash collects in your shoes and the sun beats down on your already sweaty efforts again  thankful for my own stash of water as the sign of anymore from our guide is long gonewe reach the bottom and are trundled into the same car and prepared for an hour and half journey to the hot springs we arrive  minutes later puzzled and are surprised that the hot springs are a series of swimming pools with pvc pipes at the ready spewing what i imagine contributes the only natural element to the experience we meet once again the hundreds of hikers from atop the mountain and take in the slightly hotel pool scenario with disappointmentwe are provided with a towel and a grotty looking change room with lockers before being ushered to a somewhat open looking massage quarters we are treated to great balinese massages which i actually cant fault until my masseuse demands a good tip  and in gbp i might add i cant help but leave with a sour taste in my mouththe pools are overrated and overcrowded with replicas of the same complexes all along the lake shore we take more interest in the nearby fish farms at  sharp  we are hurried by the driver to the nearby coffee plantation as we didnt know this was on the agenda we visited a plantation further north the day before and came away with some coffee tea and chocolate for the benefit of the other  guests still with us we join the coffee tour led by someone who clearly didnt want to be there and whose english didnt extend beyond his somewhat aggressively delivered script of the lewark and bali coffee processes none of us enjoyed the tourso in summary although the sunrise trek is largely rave worthy i wouldnt bother with the massage hot springs or coffee plantation add ons do the latter elsewhere in your own time as it has the potential to be interesting and seriously research the price of a guide if not bookhaggle one once in bali the best value ive seen online is  pp and includes transfer the hike and if you could call it breakfast i certainly wouldnt pay  again,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,1,1,0
3,the hiking trip itself wasnt hard at all anyone can do the trip we had to walk in line too crowded for my taste we had to go so slow that we couldnt loose a sweat if we wanted toits possible to run up the mountain in  minutes no problem starting height is about m above sea levelwe were told that we couldnt hike without a guide but i cant see the problem the path was in good condition my guess is that they says all that bullsh because of the money incomethe sunrise though was magical it was worth the trip but will not do it again,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,0,3,1

3,pros if you make it for the sunrise it is truly spectacular the views are amazing if you are lucky enough to get a cloudless daycons this is not a trek the first half of the walk is up a road that cars can drive up the second half is actually up the mountain it is not a strenuous trek but what makes it difficult is all the people there are some trying to overtake and others needing to go slower its chaos,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,1,3,0

3,my friend was visiting me from australia and since we were staying in ubud and had both heard the trek was great we decided to go last minutei had my motorbike so we figured we would just head up there for am i had heard that you have to hire a local guide at the bottom so i was expecting to pay around  or something for them wow was i wrong as soon as i pulled into the car park i was surrounded by a bunch of guys and i told them i needed a guide and their starting price was we tried to see if we could join another group and just give them some money towards their tour but the guides harassed us we tried to just walked up but were physically stopped and told that we were bad tourists and had no respect for the sacred mountain by this time we had already woken up at am and driven all that way and if we didnt head up then it would have been for nothing and we wanted to experience it so we caved and paid  eachbecause we had lost time we rode up on the bike as far as we could so we could catch the sunrise its true that there is a huge line of people and its slow moving im not very fit so that was fine for me but our tour guide recommended we take the harder but more rewarding pathwe decided to do it and push ourselves and it was really really a hard climb for me but at the top i was appreciative that we were away from the crowds in our own area our guide was really good after the initial nastiness about paying and was very kind and helpful in supporting me up the hillthe view was lovely and it was a rewarding experience so im glad i did it because it was stunning and i was proud to have made it up the steep path and our guide was one of the better ones from the other reviewsits definitely a tourist trap though and i was surprised at the huge amount of people and i really didnt enjoy being bullied at the beginningi wish the guides would set a reasonable price list and adopt a friendlier attitude its the first time ive ever dealt with this kind of aggression from locals so if you love to climb i think its a fun climb but you could also easily enjoy the sunrise from a cafe on the edge of the crater and save yourself some money,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,1,0,0

3,the beauty of the volcano has been spoilt by the littering and dirtiness at the top the walk up is not enjoyable due to the constant stream of motorbikes going up and down pestering walkers to jump on for a ride  at a cost of course the dust they kicked up is hard on the eyes and lungs especially if youre walking up in the dark to catch the sunriseit costs  to use the toilet which is appalling given you cannot traverse the volcano on your own  you must use and pay for a guide,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,1,0,0,3,0

3,as with most if not all tours you leave your ubud accommodation at around am our driver was late but this seems to be a common occurrence and there is plenty of time to get to the mountain we had a stop off at a teacoffee house for complimentary tea and coffee and a cold banana pancake the stop seemed to serve little purpose and the toilets were local style remember to bring your own toilet tissue and hand sanitizer this is also important for the toilets at the base of the mountain after this stop we continued our journey arriving at the start and meeting our guides who were very pleasant and attentivethe trek itself is definitely not easy although this is subjective if the pace is fast it will seem like torture we had a guide at the front and rear of our party and quickly after the st kilometre the younger taller members of the group strode off with the lead guide the rear guide stayed with us the route is very steep in parts to the point of scrambling and there are a lot of loose rocks under foot the incline and pace can make for quite an unrelenting journey at least k of the ascent is on this loose ground and a reason why decent footwear should be worn i saw at least one hiker wearing shower shoes in fairness at the top but i wouldnt recommend this even people in running trainers struggled due to the small loose rockswe had no sunrise unfortunately due to the clouds not clearing but the view was nonetheless spectacularwalk down was tough as this was an equally relentless downhill slog again without proper shoes this would have been very tough on the feet and unpleasanttours from ubud are around  rupees pp we paid  ive seen some tours as high as  rupees pp im not what you get for this as everyone seems to be offering the same formatthis review is not about any single tour operator as the issues are specifically related to the location not the operators,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,1,3,0
3,this was one of the best experience i had in bali our driver came to fetch us at am it is a  hour journey to mt batur reached the destination at am a guide by the name of ketut was there to bring us up the mountainwe started our trek in the dark using torch lights beginning is easyhowever it is not an easy trek uploose rocks and steep ascend in sheer darkness are not exactly the best combo for a relaxing morning hikemy boyfriend was suffering quite a bit during the hike because hes overweight and not in the best physical condition so we had to take frequent breaksat last my boyfriend called me and the guide to go ahead firstwhen nearer to the top is much much tougher than the bottombig thanks to my guide ketut if not him pulling me up along i think i will be much slowerwe waited for my boyfriend to reach the top we were glad to be able to catch the sunrise togetherhowever quite disappointed as theres no breakfast for us just only hot chocolate drink being servedwas hungry when seeing other people eating bread with eggs and bananasthe view of this volcano was incredible definitely recommended one of the best activities ,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,1,3,0
3,our mt batur experience was victory saved from the jaws of defeat based on recommendations we went to mt batur as a day excursion from ubud this mountain is famous for its sunrises but our crew of five was never going to get up at am so we decided to go midday to get out of ubud and stretch our legs we traveled to mt batur with another family so together we were  people with kids ranging from  years to  years we learned upon arriving that we needed to hire a local guide to take us up the mountain we understand the full employment plan and were very willing to contribute to the local economy but they were asking for  per person for guiding services we werent going to pay  to walk up a small mountain so we proposed  for our whole group which seemed very reasonable we almost agreed to this price when a big thunder clap and dark clouds warned of an approaching storm so we decided to bag the mountain and just walk up the trail a ways however at this point the local guides got very aggressive and said they wouldnt allow us on any road or trail without a guide we explained there was no way we were going to pay  to walk a mile or two in the rain so continued on now they got downright hostile and started threatening us with their motorbikes and the police weve traveled for three months all over se asia and weve never been threatened and harassed like these people did further to have them do this in front of a group of children was awful unfortunately everyone was upset at this point so our peaceful mountain journey was already ruined we returned to our cars and had them drive a few km down the road to find a short trail we could walk on before returning to ubud it turns out the racket covers the whole valley but our trail head was so obscure that no other guides were there we trekked on a remote path for about a km and somehow found a newly paved asphalt road that leads to a pagoda near the top of the mountain this road shows up now on google maps  on the west side of the mt we followed the paved road to within  meters of the crater rim and then walked up the trail to the top we enjoyed some great views and the rain held off until our return journeywe enjoyed mount batur but the guide scam needs to be eradicated as our experience proved they dont respect their customers and this is all about extracting money from peoplefor those visiting bali who want to do the mt batur sunrise hike i support you buying a package deal that includes a guide the trail is moderately technical and doing it in the dark could be challenging especially in the crater but guides are not required if hiking during the day,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,0,0,0
4,climbing mount batur was not on our itinerary despite a sunrise hike being the most popular thing to do in the area id read up before our trip and the active volcano seemed reasonably challenging to hike and there was always the problem of us not really having the correct footwear or clothing we decided to enjoy the view from our pool instead whilst staying for a few days in the local area,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,1,3,0
4,we didnt expect the temperature to be a low c and the area somewhat obscured by a haze it was still clear enough to enjoy and appreciate the spectacular scenery from various vantage points known to our driver it is still an active volcano no tremors felt or rumbles on the day so it seemed that the gods were happy mounty batur dominates the area two calderas at its base the southern caldera contains a lake and the village of trunyan which is noted for its unusual custom of laying the deceased on the open ground and covering with cloth and bamboo while they decompose the surrounding area has changed greatly since we last visited in  i think that i preferred my visit and the rather primitive facilities that existed then ,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,0,3,0

4,welllets go from startingfirstly find a good group if you dont have a good group to climb and you are sharing your package with a treking company please ask them to adjust you with your age group of people i by mistake got stuck with an old lady and her mom and another girl who havent done trek ever so due to that we were at the last climbing the mountain so when sharing its better to get the same fitness level of trekkers or atleast same age cause guide will not leave the group and let you go alone and taking guide is mustdriver comes to pick you up at the hotel by amam you reach a restaurant for your st breakfast by am and after breakfast the starting point is just  mins drivest breakfast like simple pancake and coffeetea which is included in the trekking package use washroom here cause washroom at starting point is chargeablethey will even pack bread and boiled eggs for you which your guide will give you on the top of mt batur after the climbnow there is a good road till the base of the mountain so its better to pay extra to ask your driver to drop you till the base from where actual climbing starts going on good proper road is good but still it will exhaust you rather you can use that energy on the real tracknow from the place the real track starts its risky so take proper light or light with head strap is good so that your hands are free to hold in case of fallthere are lot of small rocks and volcanic ash which makes the track lot slippery so good treking shoes is recommended and full pants and jacket jacket should not be heavy coz while coming down that same jacket will be heavy as when the sun comes up its get hotnow climb takes approx  hours but since its crowded on the starting so will take lot of time to climb so it will take  hours max even if you are slowyes dont forget to ask the guide the sunrise time so that you climb before thatyes there is option to go on top till the st summit by dirt bike and vijeta charge somewhere from k to k idrand from st summit its another half an hour till the top which is very very slippery due to volcanic ashnow after reaching on the top they will give you two slice of bread and one boiled egg but after sunrise and after resting and relaxing for  mins guides will even try to sell you water and drinks on the top but at very costly price so its better to carry water and drinks you want tonow climbing down is easier and faster but you will find lot of people and its slows your pace still it will not take more than to reach the base on the way you can stop at the cater and this cater is also visible from the toponce you reach the base you can ask your driver to come back to pick you uptipping the guide is good even though you have paid for their fees but they are very greedy sorry to sayafter trek you can visit batur hot water spring which is only  mins drive from the starting point but mention about this to your trekking company before hand only they charge k idr extra which includes ticket inside the hot water spa ticket costs k idryou get towel and locker facility inside with one welcome drink in the packagehot water spring relaxes you fully and you can spend good mins thereon the way back to your hotel in kutasemiyank have a nice sleep in the car  as the drive is for  hours due to trafficessentials light jacket full pants torch  headlight water and energy drink good shoes dont buy water drinks on the top as its very costly so only if neededall the bestdo reply to this comment if my review was helpfulthank you,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,1,0,1
4,we decided to do the batur sunrise trekking and we got paired with an excellent guide and a small group of people  in total as a group we had a good laugh and our guide was really fun and nice whilst making sure we stayed safe the sunrise was beautiful to watch and we were taken to see the craters monkeys etc a word of warning  the trek is tough i am a fit person who works out  times a week and have good cardio endurance and i struggled we did so the trek in an hour and a half so would probably be easier if you took longer to get up but the walk is steep and only gets steeper the further you go if you arent fit i wouldnt advise to do it we did manage to get a good price for the package of k idr each which our car operator bali carbali quality tour sorted for us and we werent hassled at all by anyone,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,1,3,0

4,my dad me and a friend booked a private guide who brought us to the top in the beginning you have a normal road in my opinion but our friend was unfit and found it really hard then there was a meeting point after min where you have to chose between the easy road and the difficult road you can also go by motorbike to a place near the top what our friend did because she was not gonna make it to the top my dad and i chose the difficult road because we like challenges but this was way to difficult haha i had to take a break every  minutes because it was really steep and you just had to take big steps the whole time but the guide said that the easy road is way to crowded and that a lot of motorbikes pass by what makes you not enjoy nature to the fullest after maybe h we met our friend back and continued a min walk to the top and enjoyes the sunrise it was beautifull but also really cold so you will definitely thank yourself later if you bring a blanket on the way back we did the easy road and it looked way more easy then the road that we did to the top we also waited untill most of the people went down so we could relax and not be bothered by big groups passing by the whole timei liked the hike and would recommend but i think when u go in summervacation it is way to crowded and difficult to enjoy,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,1,0,1
4,do not be put off by some of the reviewsmy partner and i did the sunrise trek to the top with a prebooked guide from our villa we are in our early twenties with a pretty good level of fitness we didnt find it a hard trek fitnesswise but a more technical trek where you have to focus on where you are placing your feet the first part of the trek is a steady and gradual ascent first up asphalt and then a rocky ground the last part of the trek is the hardest as the ground is a sandy ash and has little gripthere are a lot of people i wouldnt say its overcrowded like many reviews state but we may have gone on a good day some parts you have to line up waiting for other tourists but there are lots of stop areas along the way which is where we passed some of the other groupsit took us  hr  min to ascend and arrive at the top and  hr to descend going down is easier but slippery on the first part due to the loose groundtips prebook your guide it will save you money and the hassle of finding a good one amongst the locals wear good walking shoes cannot stress this enough we saw many people wearing converse and they were slipping everywhere also your shoes will get very dusty bring a warm jacket for the top as it gets cold and windy,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,1,0,1
4,we woke up at  in the morning and arrived there at about   it is about  hours to get on the top there are many people and it gets overcrowded  it is not the easiest trek mainly due to the fact that are many people going up at this particular time for the sunrise and it gets a bit challenging a little before you get on the top  the view is rewarding though if it is not foggy at the time of the sunrise  in our case it was foggy but it cleared out about  min later  so we had the chance to see a great view  worth visiting  a nice experience  oh and get a jacket with you  on the top it gets a bit cold ,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,1,3,1

4,amazing experience to climb to see the sunrise but like every other review says its standstill traffic for literally hours incredible view but youll be sharing it with hundreds of othersid read heaps of reviews and thought id be prepared not so muchhighlights it really is a stunning view for a good chunk of time once you reach the summit its not a case of walk up take a few photos for insta and wander back down you see some incredible changes in light and colour i was fortunate to have fantastic weather as well the guides are friendly like all balinese and incredibly helpful when it comes to helping you up and back down im sure all tour companies are similarreality checks you are nose to tail the entire way from the drive to the base to walking all the way to the summit we tourists we really do ruin everything our guide told us more than  people climb a day if you havent done any regular exercise in the last year or so its not going to be a walk in the park there are some clambering sections and given that it is so crowded not everyone understands etiquette and they are looking out for their own safety you really do have to concentrate its a solid two hour climb and probably an hour return its dark take a head torch the guides go at a pretty reasonable pace and its consistent be prepared to not be the dawdler in the group however the guides are incredibly generous with stops and checking on everyone wear good clothing and shoes so important its loose gravel dirt and pointy rocks of various sizes all the way up and back its not a  jeans and converse kind of activity so if you didnt pack anything active youre gonna have a bad time i underestimate how cool it was at the base and the summit so wear a hoodie and be prepared to carry it once you need to strip it off there will inevitably be some idiot with a drone or a speaker blaring awful musing as there is at every tourist attraction ruining the serenity at the top or along the path be prepared to be in a crowd just a dark trekking crowdin all honesty its quite incredible at the top and you feel quite accomplished when youre done,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,1,3,1

4,well organised trip up mount batur we were actually the only people on this trek and the only people walking up the mountain that evening which definitely improved the experience we are two relatively fit people and honestly found the trek quite hard work but our guide was very accommodating the email from the tour advised us we needed to wear long trousers but one of us got away unscathed wearing shorts i would recommend either hiking boots or trail running shoes it is very slippy in places especially coming downit was very warm ascending in the sun and then quite difficult to see the route with torches in the dark so the sunrise trek might make more sense if it wasnt for the am startits worth taking water but the driver does stop at supermarkets en route and bought us a couple of large bottles the guide made us banana sandwiches at the top of the mountain but luckily we had our own provisionswe went from sanur and it was a  hour drive each way so didnt get back until pm luckily there were still restaurants open in sanur when we got back i would recommend it but it was a difficult and tiring trek it felt dangerous in places coming down the guide had to help me we did get some amazing sunset photos though which made it all worthwhile can imagine it would have been disappointing if clouds spoilt the view however,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,3,1,3,0
4,have to admit i wasnt sure about how much i would like going to look at the volcano mt batur we didnt hike the volcano but were able to enjoy viewing from a restaurant with a beautiful view overlooking the lava field below mt batur there is a peaceful serenity surrounding the mountain along with some gorgeous scenery and i have to say it was a highlight of our morning oft times it good to go early so the view of the mountain isnt obscured by clouds or fog,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,2,2,0
4,my experience at mount batur was great there was a beautiful sunrise not too many people and friendly guides the hike wasnt too hard and i enjoyed it we woke up at around  to  am and drove there with a trip agency i cant remember its name later we stopped at a hot spring wich was very relaxing the only reason i put a four star review is because the breakfast was not the best overall i recommend going to mount batur but bring your own food,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,3,3,0,3
4,myself and  friends went to the mountain with a hired driver left at am to get there from seminyak and planned to hike without a guidewhen we arrived at the village road we got pulled over by security to pay a ticket entry which was  idr each which we had no idea about then when we arrived at the car park we tried to follow the path to the mountain with a group of other tourists but we got harassed every step of the way by several men asking who was our guide threatening us to go back to the office and pay ticket entry or they wont let us go furtherthey blocked our path and around  men aggresivly surrounded us shouting to go back until we submitted we haggled the price but still didnt have as much money as they asked due to the extra ticket fee before hand so they forced us into a car to go to an atm to get the money for them our driver advised us to go with them very scaryif you can get past these people its a very simple and easy hike up with no guide needed and bumper to bumper tourists but its not worth it for the aggregation and intimidation for what should be a nice morning out it made us all very upsetonce we paid up the guide who previously intimidated us was suddenly very relaxed and pleasant gave a good tour and showed us shortcuts up the hill took some good photos of us but had limited knowledge on the area just a few facts recited over and overthe views were amazing once the clouds cleared well worth the trip but just hire a tour guide and haggle the price not worth feeling scared for a view,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,3,0,0
4,as i have been saying in all my posts that bali was a total surprise completely different from what i have heard from people it is beyond beaches and pubsone such place i visited was kintamani volcano for people who want to explore and adventure early morning trekking could be another option which can be arranged locallythe view from the restaurants opposite to the volcano is mesmerising the restaurant serves vegetarian and non veg buffet for  rupiahfor those fearless people  there are couple of swings in the restaurant feel free to use them if you want some good pictures,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,3,0,3,0
4,we hired a tour to go to the mountain and it was expensive the only thing the tour does is picks you up they promise breakfast but it is a joke white bread and boiled eggs horrible you have to wear comfortable clothing to hike and climb and warm clothing because it is pretty cold on the mountain i would recommend taking water and some food and warm clothing tour starts early for no reason we had to stop for first breakfast which is completely unnecessary and then wait for sunrise  minutes you need to be a little bit in shape because the hike is long and you cannot hold your group members,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,2,0,0
4,view of this volcano was awesome though we just drove past on the way to the hotspring we were informed it erupted way back in  so theres plenty of history in this area we were informed that a regular hike up the slopes would take around  hours perhaps an adventure for another time,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,2,0,0
4,its pitch black youre surrounded by jungle and you can vaguely make out lights moving up the slope of an unseen giant mountain far far far above you if it wasnt for our guide im sure we would have got lost or lost the urge because this is a tough walk at freakin am but when you reach the top and the sun stares you right in the face and screams good morning it is worth the effort it truly isa few negative points there are trail bikes that can take you most of the way to the top they are a pain in the butt on the track destroy the serenity but im sure are a lifesaver for some people that are way out of their fitness depth they will cost you money and like all things price is negotiable we declined the idrk pricetag the othe rissue is the eggs and sandwiches at the top they are a waste of food we had no interest in eating after slogging it out up that hill but once at the top it is a magical sight take your time to explore and enjoy the view the walk down is a much easier proposition,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,1,1,3,0
4,whilst its been a long time since this volcano erupted you can still see the blackened areas  with nearby homes the view from the bridge is good  but like with most areas in bali every tourist spot is commercialised and everyone trying to sell you things,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,2,0,3,0
4,heyfirst thing id like to say is that if you want to do a special tour like their sunrise trek then having a guide is much more important that being said climbing the mountain in the middle of the day does not require a guide the locals are pretty much all in on a scam making up all sorts of reasons you need a guide but as you ask them questions you find out the only reason they say so is because they want to squeeze you ass for cash here are a few things to know about going guideless do it early in the morning when the path is lit yet the sun hasnt had enough time to brew rain like in the afternoon follow the path since s of people have made the way up super easy for a hiker with almost any experience dont listen to the locals unless if they bring their price down to reasonable numbers like a few dollars they dont really offer much in terms of safety or guidance paying them is more if youre into stories and giving them a livelihood donation i say donation because the people living near the volcano do just fine my biggest problem with the whole situation is that it comes off as a big scam that everyones in on they say its a matter of respect and conservation while they dont respect you enough to offer reasonable prices and dont keep the mountain clear of trash the mountain isnt super trashy which is why they could easily do a better job of it by offering an incentive like  off if you pick up a piece of trash along the way watch your step this is basically rule  with hikinghowever the context here is that rocks are a bit more sharp than usual since theyre volcanic this makes it easier to find solid footholds and more damaging for stumbles an extension of dont deviate from the path  dont go into the crater the volcano is technically active which having the guide doesnt really do anything extra for saftey other than keeping you away from obvious hazards like going into the crater where steam is released at certain spots this process of releasing pressure and heat is good for the volcano to stay chill but dont push your luck by jumping into a steam vent you dont need a guide to know that dont mess with the monkeys at the top too much theyre pretty entitled because everyone gives them food theyll basically ignore you but if you pull out any food they assume its for them dont let them push you around bring healthy snacks and avoid intimidating the males with prolonged eye contact and the mothers by getting near their babies bring a friend  this is pretty much rule  for hiking it makes the experience more fun and gives you an out if you trip and hurt yourselfthat pretty much does it for mount batur if you dont care about the sunrise experience rent a motorbike  head there earlyish in the morning the hike is pretty chill with stunning views and funny monkeys dont pay the locals a dime until they bring their prices down from outrageous to reasonable probably the worst part about the whole experience is how much of a hassle they can be about letting you go along your way,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,1,1,2,0,0
4,if your goal is to see the sunrise and views at the top then pray for clear skies if you are up for a good early morning walk in the dark and later a downward climb then go for it christmas day  resulted in a great trek up and down but the sunrise photos are nonexistent great photos of my daughter and i huddling together to stay warm and dry no rain just heavy cloud and mist guides were brilliant and supportive for the not as capable trekkers on the tour monkeys were curious i am certain that when the weather is more generous mt batur views would be fantastic,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,3,0,2,0
4, an early morning hike in the dark is suggested for the sunrise views the best season to do the trek is from april  july avoid rainy season as trekking becomes difficult its a medium level hike moderately difficult can say and will take you nearly  to  hours to reach the top totally depends on your fitness level so take breaks to enjoy the hike wear comfortable workout clothesshorts proper hiking shoes are a must to avoid slipping where rocks and gravel are loose and do carry woollens and a headlamp also carry water and some snacks carrying camera is a must to capture the most spellbinding vistas but after clicking few shots relax and enjoy the magnificent views you can book the hike with the local company and it will include everything  pickup and drop off local guide up the mountain water flashlights and simple breakfast at the top generally group tours are conducted but you can also have private guide to hike at your own pace,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam,0,0,2,0,0

5,for me the most impressive thing about the muchpictured sunset at tanah lot was a tiny dot on the horizon  miles away to the south whats that i asked my guide wisnu he answered the exciting thing about the statue of vishnu astride garuda from the moment you spot it as far away as possible is to keep your eye on it as you approach it to watch it grow in detail and magnificence as you get nearer and finally to feel its overpowering presence when you stand on the plaza and it towers over you it is an awesome monument made even more so if you keep in mind how ancient this god is and how much devotion he clearly inspires in his people what i learned from this first trip to bali is that the island is full of gigantic statues to the gods and heroes of the hindu pantheon you meet one at nearly every intersection but none is so grand as this vishnu and garuda at gwk yes the place is unfinished but i think that people who visit gwk when all of its amusements and facilities will have been done and vishnu and garuda are no longer lording it over their lonely hill those people will have a less compelling experience see it now well worth your time your money your sweat little man,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya,0,0,3,3,0

1,we came here after finding it on trip advisor and reading all the good reviews of it the reality was not as described the temple itself is both interesting and different but as the tide was in we couldnt get that close to it i didnt mind that as its part of the location of the templemy main disappointment comes from the area around the temple which isnt in any of the photos the area around it is really really built up with tourist shops and restaurants that are there to cater to the tourist market there just so much of it that it really ruins the experience and takes away from the religious site of the temple its not even as though theyre local shops that are trying to get a bit more business they have been purposely built in the area as you have to by your entrance ticket first when wade through all the shops stalls and people trying to seek you tatthere also a cliff that would give you great views of the temple but its has been covered in restaurants and cafe who wont let you step foot up there to look at the temple unless you buy something from themi was massively disappointed and underwhelmed by tanah lot and i would tell people to save their time and money and go else where as you dont really see a lot for the price you pay,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya,0,1,0,1,1
2,now i understand that this place is sacred to the hindu culture and religion and i can and do respect that it holds great value to the balinese but as a traveller it is was one of the most underwhelming sights i went to see in a  hr trip to see the top  places it was a  hour drive that i cant say was worth it for me but considering the reviews i am the odd one out there is a cultural village that situated around the temple for you to walk around but it sells the same things that every other store sells however i took advantage of the pretty surrounding scenery and took some good photos but not worth a  hour journey from ubud,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya,0,0,1,0,0

2,the sunset was pretty beautiful not much to see there except for walking along the beach and the temple i would not have came here except that my family wanted to as i thought it was slightly overratedour experience was also marred by a scam at a fruit juice shop in the complex it was a chinese fruit juice stall youll see chinese words advertising advocado ice cream and smoothies the chinese owner was proactive in getting us to go in and was fervent in recommending the menu however she intentionally failed to tell us that her menu charges in chinese yuan instead of the local currency idr imagine our shock when our bill turned out to be almost three times the normal rate in bali we informed her that it was very expensive and we didnt know her currency was not local and she plaintively ignored our comments we felt deliberately misled by her none of her local staff dared to bring us the bill and she was the only one collecting orders and paymentswe could have been more cautious with the menu but we definitely did not expected to be charged a different currency from idr please beware of this shop,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya,0,1,0,0,0

3,it didnt feel like coming to a temple at the front youll find a series of art shops that sells stuffs you can find everywhere in denpasar a sure way to immerse yourself in bali culture and the magnificence of this templethe temple itself is great the entrance gate the temple on top of the rock the pathways everything was greatly built but youll also meet the visitors in every little spot besides the statue under a tree on the stairs on top of a rock everywherei just didnt feel the magic like any other temple we frequented the experience was void of any gasp or wow or anything close yes it is beautiful but thats it,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya,0,1,1,3,1
3,this has been said before but in order to grasp the situation and see the temple and its surrounds i had to witness it for myselfand yes whoever wrote that this venue is a huge cash cow was absolutely rightentering the carpark almost gave me a heart attack as there were so many coaches parked up it resembled a bus station  and all these coaches had people in them so that equated to many hundredsthe only way i can describe the entrance and the route to the temple would be like entering a factory outlet shopping parkthere were hawkers everywhere trying to sell cheap tat which was most off puttingwalking down to the beach area and towards the temple there was a cave which supposedly housed a holy snake but in order to see it you had to part with more money but i think i know by now what a snake looks like even a holy one at thatwalking further up the hill towards the cafe we encountered more shops selling more tat crazy really but many of the shops were selling full native american head dresses for some reasonweird thatso a word of advise  unless of course you desperately want to walk round with hoards of people  being accosted by hawkers i would suggest you read up about this temple and look at as many pictures as you can  or better still buy a video so you can experience this place in the comfort of your own armchairbut having said that i am pleased to have witnessed the hoards et all for myself and the saddest part of it all isthat you cant even get into the temple to see it,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya,0,0,0,0,1
3,visit this place during sunset its an amazing view with sunset as the backdrop and the waves hitting the rocks you have opportunities of capturing good photograph its too crowded during that time most of the temple is restricted and blocked going inside after certain distancethe priests there are a little greedy they will not give you the holy water until and unless you drop some money on the platesetting aside the priests behaviour its a must visit place if you plan to purchase some genuine purple rice you have paddy fields around where you could buy some small quantity depending on how much is allowed in flights,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya,0,1,0,0,2

3,beautiful temple with lots of history around it you need a guide to make it come to life so worth investing in this i went early morning so less tourists and could see the locals going in with offerings and holding a ceremony which was a better and more authentic experience you can pay a donation to be anointed but i personally felt it intrusive although they did offer when there was clearly a big ceremony going on its still a place of worship and its something i might only have considered outside of worship times there are some great views of the coast line and you can walk quite far in low tide,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya,0,3,0,3,0

1,we did the three day two night hike at mount rinjani sembalun  crater rim  summit  lake  crater rim  senaru we were very excited and really wanted to enjoy the hike and there were some good bits there are some lovely panoramas we got great views of ebony leaf monkeys and our guide and porters were caring and friendlyhowever overall the experience was downright depressingas we started towards the crater rim from sembalun descending hikers warned us it was dusty but it wasnt dust we were walking through it was the natural byproduct of major erosion the trails are a disgrace we lost count of the number of trees having the soil scrapped out from under their roots these trees will die and all the creatures that depend on them will be in serious troublewhen we got to the crater rim it became so much worse i cannot describe the amount of rubbish  food wrapping bits of plastic eggshells lots of toilet paper the trails just outside the huge main camp area were strewn with human faeces it was simply disgusting and an insult to such a beautiful areathe next morning we summited the mountain and probably should have descended back to camp with a sense of achievement however again we were appalled by the erosion of the trail we walked through gullies so severe you could take photos and put it in a text book as a quintessential example of gully erosion or how not to manage a trailby this point we were really depressed and feeling bad about contributing to the destruction of a beautiful and important landmark but i said im sure it will get better when we get down to the lake i figured less people go there and its a sacred site so it will be fine i couldnt have been more wrong no matter how bad the crater rim was the lake was so much worse there were piles and piles of rubbish some half burnt some fresh dumped everywhere while on the crater rim there were some attempts are creating toilet areas at the lake there were no facilities and no rules meaning there was human excrement everywhere the lake is stunning from a distance but up close it was one of the most disgusting places i have ever been it make me completely depressed about humanity and our interaction with the earththen it was up to a different part of the crater rim where there was rubbish everywhere and a descent down to senaru through more severe gully erosionoverall the experience was incredibly depressing clearly not enough resources are being expended protecting the mountain and its flora and fauna even if i tell myself well i didnt leave rubbish and our porters were good the lack of a proper strategy around sanitation and the fact i walked on already terribly eroded paths means i made a huge contribution to the problem which i deeply regretto be honest id recommend not climbing rinjini if you want to climb a mountain have a look at mount kinabalu in sabah malaysian borneo the authorities governing mount kinabalu are really uptight its expensive and you have to book ahead because they limit numbers but at least they are making some effort to protect their spectacular resourceim sorry to be writing such a scathing review as i said the local people we met were all lovely but mount rinjani requires a higher authority to clean the place up develop some strategies based on conservation best practice and the ensure these are adhered to until this happens id recommend against climbing mount rinjani,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,1,3,0,1,0

1,run do not walk away from the idea of trekking mt rinjani if youre an extreme sportsadventures enthusiast whos at top level fitness and enjoys putting your life in danger then by all means go right ahead and trek mt rinjani otherwise dont do it this mountain is not just hard to climb its dangerously difficult in some areas i did the  day night trek and was mentally done by the end of day   and ive summitted mt kilimanjaro almost every part of this mountain is steep i mean steep and day  includes lots of sliding in loose dry dirtrocks for basically the entire afternoon just when you think you reach the top of a hillnope its not the top youve still got hours to go i decided not to summit on day   day  was so miserable for me and the  hours of nonsummit walking to be done on day  were enough to convince me that was the right decision for me going down was just as hellacious as going up prepare for noodles legs within minutes we walked about  hours to the lake segara anak and hot springs had lunch then had to climb another mountain for  hours to get to that nights camp up on a ridge at  point i couldnt even figure out where my feet should go because it was just dirt on a very steep slope at this point i had to banish from my mind the image of falling to my death like the idiot i was to go on that stupid trek in the first place the guide told us that there was no emergency plan for if someone gets hurt up there and that many porters have died up there like it was no big deal day  was rainy which turned out to be a good thing because it made the loose gravel going down the other side of the mountain a little less slidey this was a  hour walk it wasnt as horrible as days  and  mainly because the end was in sight also dont be fooled by this geopark rinjani and green rinjani crap theres garbage littered all the way up and almost all the way down i saw garbage from cooking vegetable and fruit peels discarded drink cans water bottles gum candy and biscuit wrappersi even saw discarded panty liners at  different points and just in case youre expecting a pit latrine or any type of basic bathroom facilities dont that doesnt exist on mt rinjani the views were great but honestly they werent worth it to me would i go again definitely not would i recommend it i emphatically wouldnt i could have spent  days binge watching game of thrones instead trust me  find something else to do anything is better than this,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,1,0,0,1,0

2,i did the two day crater rim trip with a local tour company that were great but the mountain itself was disgustingso much garbage plastic toilet paper wet wipes human waste tampons etc this i coming from both porters and touristsit was sad and quite unbelievable that when i mentioned it to others a few didnt notice yet every place you stepped on to go to the bathroom you would step on human waste and toilet paper not an ounce of an attempt to bury it hiking in the mountains we must respect nature pack it in pack it out even your toilet paper it doesnt compost as quickly as you think and other people dont need to see your garbage as well bury your waste properly if you dont know what that means google it and you will be guidedthe locals are not as educated as the rest of us when it comes to garbage so if you plan to hike this trail please respect it garbage along the trails was numerousalso there was a woman with a drone at am when people came to watch the sunrise in a small spot the woman decided her work was more important than to respect the many others that had paid to hike up this steep ft trail to see a sunrise but she didnt care so her drone i am sure appeared in many photos not to mention the noise the drone createsi was disappointed in the trail and the disrespect to the mountain and to the other tourists to me its not worth it the view is great but there are better places to be where you can truly enjoy a mountain top,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,1,1,0,0,1
2,firstly i must say that mt rinjani is a truly spectacular place plus the guide and porters who took us up there were fantastic so why the poor rating simply because of the way in which the whole area is managed which consequently has led to the few paths and campsites being overrun with people completely covered in rubbish and even worse human waste ie shtwe booked a  day  night trip but told our guide that we couldnt actually think of anything worse than staying another night plus we bumped into other tourists who claimed that they saw human sht floating in the hot springs which was our next stop after the summitall trekkers are funnelled down one main path and only allowed to stay at one of the three campsites there are no bins and no toilet facilities resulting in everyone chucking their rubbish on the floor and crapping in the nearest bush as there are hundreds if not thousands of people trekking at any one time you can imagine what impact this must have on the surrounding environmentthese huge issues could so easily be resolved by the park authorities who after charging everyone to enter the park seem to pocket the cash and do nothingall they need to do is simply create more trekking routes and campsites to help disperse the huge crowds of people install basic long drop toilet facilities install various bintrash sites for people to dispose of their rubbish heavily fine those trekking companies guides and porters who chuck their rubbish or crap on the floor if there isnt the funding available which would amaze me if there isnt then charge more for the park entrywe did go during a busy time directly after ramadan when all the locals are on holiday but i really want people to put more pressure on the park authorities to stop this beautiful place being completely ruined i cant understand how others are leaving such positive and misleading reviewstrust me it is much worse than you think it will be especially during the busy seasonif you are reading this and wondering on what to do climb a different volcano there are loads in indonesia and with less touristsor even better find a guide who will take you off the horrifically beaten track away from the crowds and the rubbish you would have the most amazing timebut if you have no problem with rubbish and human waste everywhere then just trek with everyone else youll love it,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,1,3,0,1,1

3,i signed up for the  days  nights tour to the lake rather than the summit after reading about how tough the experience would be online our company was great we signed up to one from gili air and the guide porters and food were excellent and couldnt really be faulted however the trek was ridiculously tough i climbed to everest base camp a couple of years ago and honestly found this to be as tough or even harder at times i really struggled to keep up and found that most people were struggling through rather than enjoying the experience the views are nice but the fact that it is so draining and tiring means you cant really enjoy it most people in my group seemed to feel the sameoverall  sign up to this if you want a physical challenge rather than if you want an enjoyable few days hiking i am still struggling to move my muscles and certainly need a few days on the beach to recover,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,3,0,0,0
3,my husband and i are experienced hikers and have done hiking trips around many places in asia we would not recommend the dn trip unless you are an experienced hikers with all of the appropriate gear including head lamp hiking sticks warm waterproof jacket and hiking boots if you do not meet these criteria i do not think you will have much fun on this hike it is physically demanding and parts of the hike are very technical we enjoyed the first day of hiking up the mountain and the difficulty level was as we expected from all of the research we had done however on the nd morning as we tried to hike to the summit it rained very heavily and was zero degrees we had brought warm clothes but quickly we were soaked it was pitch black and we were still  minutes from the summit sadly we decided to turn back rather than risk hypothermia our experience is a good example of how quickly circumstances can change on the mountaintop and even for two experienced hikers it didnt work out luckily we had an hour to warm up in our tent and have breakfast before the hike back down which the first two hours were very challenging because everything was wet and quite steep there were some beautiful views marred by the garbage and the stench from the makeshift toilets but on balance it wasnt the best hiking experience we have had,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,1,0,0,0,0

4,mount rinjani is a beast but worth itthe views from the campsites and the summit are awesome this is what makes the hike worth it the lake looks stunning in the crater below but be preparedwe read many reviews saying it was extremely hard however none of them prepared us for the summit now we are relatively fit  year olds so thought we could tackle anything which we did but with difficulty what makes it so hard is the sand like ground you are walking up at a very steep gradient so every two steps you take forward is the equivalent to just one its also freezingwe went with cakrawala due to its great reviews and they didnt disappoint mr sultan was great at organising everything and his guides and porters were fantasticthe only grumble is the amount of rubbish up here the mountain authorities try to employe a pack it out pack it in policy but it is not enforced they must try harder,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,1,1,0,0,0
4,we did the nd trek to the summit of mount rinjani firstly this is a very challenging trek and only advised for those with some mountain experience  anyone trying to sell it as anything else is lying for your custom and moneywe trekked from sembalun with bas rinjani trekking  one guide and two porters for two persons the first day is approximately km through very exposed terrain so in the height of summer this would make it even moreof a challenge as it was in winter  we still found the sun very hard to deal with for the first few hours especially in an already extreme environment where all your strength needs to be conserved the food provided was excellent and youll need it as we consider ourselves fairly strong walkers but the first day took eight hours of trekking the second day is the beast  you set off at am and it took us four hours of heavy slog in a sandy rocky surface where every move takes the effort of three steps to reach the summit there is no denying that the view is wonderful and makes up for the toil however the down climb is precarious with obvious landslides all over the mountain  our experience was one where we did question whether it had been a safe decision strong walking boots and poles are essential for this climb along with warm clothing for the summit it took us   hours back to the crater and then another five hours down km total for both daysthe landscape of the mountain is eerie as much of the hillside has been destroyed by fire and some trees were still openly smoking  the guide did not really explain what had caused this and we felt that much had been hidden prior to our trek including the obvious damage caused by the earthquake we felt this was in part due to the earthquake last year that has obviously devastated tourism to the mountain as the summit route had only been open a week or so before our attempt it was hard to see that this had been such a flourishing business now pulled back to a few groups on the mountainat one point you walk under a section of rockfall that feels very precarious and not much would take more rock to dislodge and fall across the route it seemed that the government were no longer interested in investing in the mountain and much could be improved with solid financial support for the trails and removal of huge amounts of rubbish that littered everywhere many of the porters wore flip flops which was incredibly sad to see and more should be done to get tourists to support companies that pay their porters appropriately to ensure they are treated fairlyour review of bas rinjani trekking  we paid  per person excluding tips for our experience which included transfers to our hotels and the home stay the night before the trek we felt this price was fair but unfortunately had some bad points as regards our experience we found communication with bas prior to the trek excellent but he seemed non existent on our arrival in senaru and we had to search him out for an explanation of the trek what to expect etc and when our breakfast was late the day of the trek it did not fill us with confidenceour guide was friendly enough on the first day but his english wasnt brilliant and he did not appear to have had any mountain training the second day he walked much of the route very far in front  it was like we did not have a guide much of the time and it appeared he didnt really want to be there maybe not after a  times this was a shame and made us concerned that if something had gone wrong he would not have been able to have helped usthe porters however were fantastic  incredible human beings who carried our food and lodging for the two days up to the crater rim the fried banana we had after the first day was incredible we had nothing but admiration for their perseverance and sheer strength and endurance also the driver who took us from senaru to the summit start and finish was safe kind and friendly,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,0,0,1,0
4,this was by far one of the toughest hike ive ever done it was worth it to me upon reaching the peak it was beautiful and the visible stars in the sky even better sunrise and sunset was nice toothe only animals ive seen sadly is dogs and monkeys they told us there are pigs and deers but didnt encounter anythe tour guide and people carrying our food are extraordinary to be able to carry lbs up the mountain is beyond my understanding since i struggled to carry my own weighti do recommend the hike but be prepared for a challenge its very steep and requires extra caution take your time but not too much since its about  hours hike and thats at a decent pace,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,3,0,0,0
4,my friend and i hiked mt rinjani in late july of  leaving at am to climb up once we got to the gate we where hassled to hire a guide and or porters but we are experienced climbers and came prepared with our packs fully packed including food water tent etc we were physically forced to buy a train entrance fee where it was rp for locals but then rp for foreigners per day when we asked for documentation or identification one of the porters threw on a shirt with an ironed on badge and said he was the government after yelling and screaming at us we had to pay the fee but when we asked where the money was going and they said to the government to stop corruption which is telling of the operation being run out of the tent as the situation escalated a kind guide approached us and helped us get on the mountain so if you are ones looking to book a porterguide book through aman trekker rinjanisummitcomonce that was sorted out we had our tickets paying rp for the both of us for two days on the mountain and we made sure we were not getting a guide we hiked up the trail which was easy to follow because there was just one continuous trail up to the crater rim the trail itself however was very steep and once we were above the tree line the trail became very dry dirt which made it difficult at times our legs were on fire my the time we reached the last rest stop but at the same time we were moving at a fast pace arriving to pos cemara  at amwe rested for a little less than an hour where another group with a guide arrived as well and that guide august informed us that we needed to get up before the porter groups claimed the campsites on the summit our final push was even steeper but once we arrived to the top wind was howling out of the crater and up the side of the mountain which made our tent set up a little challenging but not impossible the tent we rented was a low quality tent that had broken zippers on the rain fly as well as door which was our mistake for not properly checking before we began in the morningwe watched the sun set into the clouds which was incredible to see while all the other tour groups were also around us having their campsites and food prepared for them by the porters but thats the premium they pay for we were fine on our own eating dry food and camping ourselves but i would warn that the trail is fairly dirty and not well maintained by the park officials using the quotations quite literally here once on the mountain the porters and guides are very friendly but you just have to push through in the beginning at the gate aman told us about the app erinjanj where anyone can book tickets so that might save you from nearly fighting the staff thereall in all it is a steep and difficult climb but if you take your time going up and down anyone can accomplish it book tours for convenience but you can absolutely complete it yourself if you come prepared and have some outdoor experienceknowledge,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,1,0,0,0

4,i decided to tackle this mountain after seeing it online it was rather a lastminute decision and had no prior experience to hiking before but i would consider myself to be quite fit and my sister and i decided to go for the dn packagewe started from sembalun village which was an hour drive away from where we were staying in senaru and trekked up to the sembalun crater rim base camp on the first day we proceeded up to the summit the next morning at am and the h trek proved to be incredibly challengingthe views at the top as we witnessed the sun rise was well worth it though we then descended down rather steep descent the mountain and head towards senaru lake and the hot springs before we faced an equally challenging climb up to senaru crater rim for night be grateful for the porters and guides that come on the trek with you as the porters carry kg worth of food and shelter for you guys and carry it along the trek in just slippers its amazing what they can do all with smiles on their facesthe biggest problem that came with this experience was the excess amount of trash that can be seen along the trail its sad that people are not able to clean up after themselves and dispose of their trash properlysome tips its recommended to wear hiking shoes as they have a much better grip bring a walking stick i didnt have one but itll help a bunch and bring a mask or something to cover your face because all the dirt and dust will get on your face and in your bodysince its a natural setting its evident that it wont be the most hygienic of places but itll definitely help you appreciate the simple things that we have in our comfortable livesprobably the worst muscle soreness suffered from this trip but its definitely a once in a lifetime experience that i dont regret,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,1,3,3,0,0
4,we booked a one day trekking trip from senaru village to crater rim with my wife only one week before arriving to lombokour trekking started at am from our hotel trekking companys staff was very nice and in total we were very pleased with their servicebad news is that they didnt inform us well about the trip in first place they told us that one day trekking would be  hours of walking and approximately  km it doesnt sound that badbut at the end we bet it was much much more someone else wrote that they calculated the actual distance with their app and it was about km at the end i can agree on that our trekking day took about  hours with only  min short breakswe are in a good shape go to gym  times a week and run and cycle still it was most def the hardest physical experience weve ever had if you are not sporty type i wouldnt recommend this one day trekking trip at allalso when we got closer to the rim trekking was actually climbing without proper equipment the staff told us normal sneakers would be ok but it appeared that our sneakers were way too slippery we had to focus on every step so we wouldnt get hurtbe wiser that us book at least  or  days trip prepare well and get yourself a proper climbingtrekking equipment people have actually died during their trekking trips in mount rinjani so it is not a jokeanyway it was a fun experience and i can highly recommend it for those who love very challenging sports activities,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,1,0,0,0
4,to reach the peak of mount rinjani at m is the wish of every mountain climbers however to scale the peak is not easy and this climb is comparatively much more difficult than the m high mount kinabalu it is recommended to do the  days  nights hike porters will bring all essentials up and made shift toilet with small dug hole in dent will take care of our need the first day hike will bring us to the rim of the cradle and this hike is not too difficult we will dent there eat an early dinner and sleep early and wake up at around pm eat some food and get ready for the hike to the peak to view sun rise this climb is difficult because of the loose screeds it is very dusty and the constant sliding back makes the climb very tiring the last stretch to the peak is especially tiring and disheartening but seeing every one struggling to proceed does provide some encouragement for us to proceed the view at the peak is marvelous we descend back to the cradle rim took our breakfast and continue all the way down to the lake side the whole journey can be  hours and is rather tiring the view at lake side is equally nice we climb from lake side to the other side of cradle rim on the rd day looking back to the lake when climbing to cradle rim provides fantastic scenery at different heights the last day is very relaxing just walking back and to complete the hiking,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,3,0,0,0

4,if you fo to lombok you might do it because you dont want to spend all time on bali or the gilis lombok is more real nature rough and it offers the rinjani the rinjani is a volcano that is worth hiking but think about it for a moment this takes at least one night and two days the climb up takes roughly  hours and while others carry your bag and its still very heavy than you reach the base camp youll meet others eat drink laugh and go to sleep in a tent around  a clock in the evening sleeping wont go well and they wake you up at  at night for the climb to the top this is in total darkness and in the cold please prepare yourself with lots of water snacks warm clothing dry clothing and a headlight after the first few  meters itll be loose sand  steps up and  step down a lot of people give up with bleeding feet hurting knees and exhaustion is it doable yes but only if you are prepared and have a decent physical condition if you reach the top youll be at a magical setting shared with other survivors while watching one of the most beautiful sunrises ever i watched it with tears in my eyes ill never do it again i was so exhausted and had so much pain in my feet and knees but i am so happy that i did it and shared the experience,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,3,0,3,0

4,lots of people have commented on this trip and i dont want to waste your time repeating many of the things youve probably already read sono matter how tough you find this trip the views and sense of accomplishment are totally worth it dont believe people thay say you need a certain level of fitness you just need a certain level of determination  anyone can keep walking caveat if you do the  day night this requires a very small amount of nontechnical climbing and is not just a hikegoing up to the summit is as hard as everyone says however my tip to help you is this kick your toe in to the stonesand so you have a solid platform to push off from this will stop your standing leg sliding back on the loose soil and thus the whole two steps forwards one step back thing progress will feel slow but i promise you is better than trying to slip slide and scramble all the way up obviously durable walking shoes or boots are more appropriate for this than say a running trainerthe rubbish sigh yes theres loads of it but what no one seems to have mentioned is what this does to the overall experience other than impact on your views campsites are surrounded by rubbish which you can imagine attracts flies so after a hard days slog you settle down to eat your evening meal only to find yourself in the middle of a rubbish tip swatting off flies and the crater lake has the rubbish floating around the shores it really is grossi would still recommend this trip though  you get to climb an active volcanoe nearly km high with views over a crater late the entire island and neighbouring bali it really is incredibleif i were to do it again i think i would incentive my guides to take their rubbish with them in the way of a pre agreed tip perhaps,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,1,3,0,0,0

4,great mt rinjani lake solo experience bit of a background for a full picturei travel to lombok often and mt rinjani was on my list for a long timei am  years old runner not fit enough for my standards but probably fitter than many on the mountain also need to say i am a sea level creature so alps residents would have an immediate advantagei enjoy heights views and nature but priority is an exercise particularly with a challenge rather than just to make the photo on the topi was unable to get any suitable advice on mt rinjani even from my lombok friendsaud    was not acceptable to me therefore i went to investigate myself and this is the following observationarrived at senaru near the waterfalls and the entrance late afternoonnext morning at  oclock did not have any breakfast prior exercise as usual left for the waterfallsgoogle map was suggesting a secret track from the base of the waterfalls after  km and  hours of searching i found only obviously obstructed possible passages however even pass the obstruction it did not appear as a good choice due to extremely steep and slippery overgrown paths despite gps i ended up in  different places  x and decided its time to give up therefore i headed to the official gate which was the th km of my track that dayat  i paid aud the entrance fee finished  litres of water and took another  ltr with me as no more fitted into the pouchthe hill starts right at the entrance and it is surprisingly equally steep almost to the lake the faster you go the more challenging it gets as you would expect my average speed was kmh up to the  ft altitude around  kmsone needs to be careful not to slip or fall but exposed tree roots provides often the best supporti believe at this stage you need certain fitness however no climbing experience nor any climbing equipment is requiredsimply the less fit you are the slower you gothe first  kms up to  feet was hard enough to break sweat but no stops nor water were required by my bodypeace of piss i though at that stage despite the fact that i barely matched the speed of bare foot or thongs wearing sherpas with  kg on their shoulders km to go only  of what i already covered from base in  hours ill see the lakes at no timeat six thousand feet altitude i appreciated the water i brought and used it wisely i also noticed i had to stop few times to catch breath my speed slowed down below kmhour and i thoughthats fair considering the climb my age and  km behind me on that day including my not very successful short cut at the beginninghowever within the next  feet altitude i have noticed my stops became more frequent and i even sat down for couple of minutes here and there obviously i noted my average speed deteriorated furtherat  ft i and  km to the lake i have though for the first time i may not make it considering i have to go the whole way back to the hotel my water consumption dramatically increased but as there were friendly hikers with water supply i pushed forward i always kept what i needed for the descentas i have not previous experience with steep high altitude no stop climbing i believed my energy is deteriorating due to simple exhaustion and needed to save the remainder for slow and save descendat  feet  km to go i had to stop every  to  meters and decided its time to turn aroundit simply made no sense as my speed was below kmh and decreasing the last kilometre maybe km would take me  to  hours and i possibly would destroy the reserves i still had leaving no energy for safe descent on timeon the way back at  feet i had a pleasant drink stop and a chat with a friendly guide for about  minutessurprisingly that was all i needed for the rest of the descend to the entrance as i was descending my energy was returning very fast to the point that i no longer felt exhaustion and did not need to stop the whole way downi have returned  hours prior sunset at  o clock i did not feel i need rest  unlike i expected earlier and with no difficulties got on the scooter and drove  kilometres to another hoteli would lie thou if i said i did to have a very good sleep that night summarisingi believe now my exhaustion was caused by fast climb to low barometric pressure at maximum energy available all the time rather than simple lack of body daily energy supplygroups i have met at  oclock near the lakes started at   hours before my departure at i started  hours after sunrise and came back  hours prior sunset i would not make it back before sunset if i continued to the lakes therefore next time i will start just before sunrise with plenty of reserves to make it to the lake and backplease note there was no plan nor urgency to reach any particular destinationit was just another exercise day with investigation purposescomparingthe climb itself appeared harder for me than  km run on a warm day possibly hardest exercise i had recorded confirmed by few record flags by runkeeperthe descend was easy but required extra caution to prevent injury due to slipping and or fallingif future climbs should i run out of energy in such suspicious way on ascent i would push on knowing the energy will fast return on descent obviously still allowing reserves for sunseti will take  litres of water maybe few oranges and a block of chocolate for the extra performancethe temperature was never an issue as i was moving at all time knowing there is a reasonable and fast return to warmer temperatureslittle bit disappointed because it felt little bit as a highway with traffic going both directions stopping for the rest and or for the night on the other hand i have gained extra safety should anything go wrongnext trip will be to the lakes and as far further as the sunset allowsdepends on those findings the hike after next may be across the lakes and return via the other site of the mountain subject my theory that the lakes were only km  hours away and no more then  hours around the lakes to the other sitewell and then it is only one other thing which can be added however at this stage i believe it will require an overnight stopany way this is my experienceplease do not consider it in any way as suggestion that it is an easy hike for an untrained or even worse unfit personhowever i believe reasonable fit person should make it to the lakes with a guide with no extreme difficulties the less fit you are the longer it will take but i see no obstacles to achieve the lake for most healthy and many less healthy people in my opinion if time is no concern it is rather determination than the physical ability what gets you all the wayi believe i was the only hiker without a guide on the day and i understood the reasons for it the paid guides and sherpas are your comfort and safety while their aud a week is well deserved  forget where the rest of your  go  never the less your own and very personal  to  kg still have to be carried up by yourselfplease note i am active all my life served in the navy as a diver and run on average  km a month i do not mind to rough it up and have some survivals experience and skillshappy to reply to any questions or if you fit and fun even to join me on my next

4,we took the dn trip from sembalun booking through chicken feet travels agency singapore we later found out that these guys ms jin completely ripped us out on price  got charged at least  more than booking directly through andreas expedition which was the tour group we were eventually booked with first tip  stay away from these sub agents and book directly through the local tour groups  good ones we heard were andreas green rinjani and john adventuresi will directly go to the key points in this trek extremely challenging trek  you need to have good fitness and prior trekking experience is a must this trekl will be the most difficult physical thing you ill do in your life  steep incline tough terrain which you cover in very short span of time over  m in single day which is not normal at all dn trek offers very little time to pause and enjoy the stunning views you walk all day and reach the camp so late in the day completely exhausted that there is no time to savour anything day  will be the most unforgettable and torturous day  day starts  am to go to summit m to m then you come down by  am and post breakfast get downw to lake m to m finish lunch there and then trek back to other side of crater m to m basically trek from  am to  pm  hrs with break of maybe  hours it will drain you physically and mentally carry very light  not more than  kg  it gets cold at top  carry fleece jacket trekking poles and good trekking shoes are must your guide and the porters are your gods up there treat them nicelytip  do a dn trek instead which gives some respite or best  dont do it the end,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,3,0,0,0

4,lucky enough to share with my son the trek up to the rim of mt rinjani a tough ask for me  years old but well worth the effort we started a  am and trekked for almost  hours but had breaks for snacks and lunch and the terrain at times was very challenging the view was just spectacular at  m and as the night closed inwe witnessed an amazing sunset over bali a chilly night ahead and little sleepneed warm clothes saw my son and i gaze at the sun rising over the neighboring island of sumbawaa visual feast the trek down was not so challenging and only took about  hours certainly well worth the effort and i will do it again soon,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,3,0,0,0

4,there is no doubt the view from mt rinjani is a once in a lifetime experience  but there are a few things you should know before trekking the mountain is closed from jan  to end of march we found this out the hard way as many operators will still take your money the main reason to avoid the trek at this time is that it is the rainy season we trekked jan th this year and luckily it was still drybut on the last day the rainy season began and we only just made it out through a number of river crossings due to the rains and no government maintenance  the track is appalling and unsafe in areas as in railings are falling down everywhere and there are huge cutouts in the trail personally i wouldnt let this stop you but it means you need to know the risks and be extra safe on steep climbs unfortunately there is also a lot of rubbish along the track so please take a plastic bag and collect some  and encourage your guides to not leave anything behind you will need trekking boots and waterproof jacket and also warm jacket as it does get cold a walking stick would also be highly recommended as there are many slippery downhill areas this trek is hard i have done everest base camp and i still thought this trek was potentially more challenging in areas just due to the technical aspects  as in a lot of hazards and not a great trail it is one of the most amazing views  and totally worth it when you get to the rim due to the latest eruption of the active volcano in the middle of the lake our guide admitted in the end that they actually are not really supposed to take people down to the lake and hot springs the walk down is also very steep again as a personal opinion i would give the lake a miss it is lined with rubbish and you dont feel like swimming in it when you reach the bottom plus it means you then need to walk back up the next day which is a killer if i did it again i would just go to the rim and back for the awesome views the best views by far are from the senaru end you can hardly see the volcano from the sembalun end unless you summit not sure if you can walk up to the rim from senaru and then across without going down to the lakepossibly you can the quickest way to summit however is from the sembalun end the summit walk it very slippery due to sandy little rocksso you need really good grip and a walking stick if possible they also summit in the early hours of the morning when it is dark so you need a good head torch make sure you check out all of the gear provided the night before to ensure they give you decent tents matresses and jackets if provided accommodation is really basic and ours had dirty sheets  so maybe best to bring a sarong or towel to lay on pack as light as you can possibly packit is a tough walk pack sunscreen and a hat and long sleeve shirt extra socks and bandaids  bandages enjoy it really is an amazing trek its just that the government and park rangers do not maintain anything,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,1,0,0,1,0

4,i trekked rinjani solo carrying all my own gear including tent sleeping bag food and water i started from sembalun walked into the park from the main public road and i did not pay park fees or register normally i would have but the park office is far off the trail they charge foreigners more than locals and the park is not maintained well and is in horrible conditiontrash and feces everwhere most companies charge between  usd for the summit trek and provide tents food guides and porters to carry your stuff guides are not necessary as theres only one trail and its easily discernable porters are generally loaded with  kilos of guest gear and supplies and make the  daytwo night trek for only   to   rupees  usd for the whole thing you can be the judge on whether to use a company and porters but they are treated horribly and i dont believe in human slavery i also dont think you should be on the mountain if you cant carry your own gear but enough of my soapbox theres water sources at base camp and the second nights camp and there is another natural spring by the hot springs down by the lake no need to carry more than  liters of water to start and you can refill your bottles along the way the climbing is difficult because of scree but not technical and just takes a positive attitude and perservereverance there are many spots to camp and no one messed with my tent noise at night is a problem so bring earplugs the time estimates going up were generally accurate but i made it down from pos  on the last day in  hours not  i guess my knees are better than most take panadol or ibuprofen it helps and please dont poop alongside the trail go some distance away and bury it and pack out your trash,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,3,0,1,0
4,this was so worth the trek but should not be taken lightly my husband and i are fairly fit people our job scuba instructors requires us to be active all day and we had a few struggle moments especially the first day towards the end the climb is much steeper than we anticipated but was so worth the view when we woke up my advice keep your pack light once you add the weight of water to drink it gets heavy but bring enough layers and change of clothes we got poured on so we had to change as soon as we reached the top and our original clothes never really dried also bring chocolate and nuts there is plenty of food provided by the trekking company but your body needs those calories on between definitely recommend real hiking shoes the people we saw in trainers were having some real issues we also brought wet wipes which came in hand lastly bring and empty plastic bag to bring down any trash you create it was sad to see people get some complacent with natureit is worth the journey and just think when you only have to be able to walk to the nearest massage place once you get down ,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,1,0,0,0,0
4, main points of advice lots of layers and warm jacket and et again more clothes than youll think you need because youll need it all waiting for the sunrise on top on rinjani drains the life out of you bring baby wipes the walk is very sandy and you will be covered in a layer of dust until everything you own and you yourself is just one shade of brown be mentally tough because the am trek up to the peak itself is one of the hardest things i have ever done in my life the terrain is super tough as its all sand and very steep being in good shape and having good stamina from doing crossfit everyday my partner and i were still struggling loads youll get there it will take time and lots of willpowerso other than that the park is beautiful but very dirty from lots of plastic and trash thrown every where which is such a shame could have been such a beautiful and serene place but the fact that is looks like a dump on the main camping sites and stops takes the feeling out of it,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,1,0,0,0,0

4,we did  days  night we went until the crater rim the view is wonderful on the crater volcano and the sea i didnt go on the summit  or  days but i find the view is super on the crater so i would say  days is enough for people not being mad of trek the trek is super difficult especially the d day to go down and come back in senaru you use too much your muscles of legs i find that the organization of these treks done by all the companies and freelancers we can find is not really goodthe porteurs are all in flipflops or barefoot they bring stuffs in asian baskets not adapted it would be better if they had mountain bags they have just a tee shirt and a short for the  or  daystheir hygiene is really limitedand they make the food of customersthey do poo everywhereso now there is poo almost everywhere in the forest and on the mountain with toilet papera lot of left camp trashesthere is  worlds in this experience the world of the porteurs and guides and the world of the customers customers have nice tents mattresses toilet tentthe others not the companies could be an effort to give a nice equipment to their employees they work in really bad conditions whereas we pay a lot for these treks around  millions of roupies for  days bosses of companies keep most of the money for themeverybody could have access on the camp to a toilet tent with a hole it would avoid to have poo everywhere companies dont contribute finally to keep a nice mountain without poo and trash everywhereits a shame we pay the entrance of the park but we dont see where our money is used to maintain the parkso hard physical effort nice view beautiful natural site but damaged by people,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,1,2,0,1,0

4,we made a dn trek to the summit of mount rinjani in april  overall it was a very positive experience thanks to the excellent organisation of the local company we had chosen our friendly and competent guide ihwan our good luck with the weather and because we were prepared well enough for the hard trekking also thanks to the reviews we had readfrom the first email answer on we got from abul we could trust everything would be fine it certainly was for a fair price we got good guidance nice food surely enough of it even snacks proper tent and sleeping bags our guide ihwan or wan number one was enhousiastic about his work took responsibility for us coping with all the difficulties was nice company to talk with our two porters made a huge job in carrying everything along the steep slopes and turned into perfect cooks when not carrying all three of them took conscientiously all the garbage back down ihwan also taking part of the project of cleaning garbage of othersunfortunately in spite of the efforts of many garbage still is a big problem on the rinjani trek and this why the trek itself was not a fivestar experience for us on campsites and at lunchbreak shelters you still can see lots of paper plastic food rests  according to our guide mostly left by independent local trekkers most of the paths are in rather clean condition the lakeside was probably the worst and thats why it was quite good we didnt spend an extra night there although the second day was quite a long oneas for the trek itself the views from the rim and the summit really make the effort worthwhile in this still green time of the year we could also enjoy the scenery during the ascent from sembalun no dust yet and descent to senaru shady forest it has often been stated that the ascent to the summit is a hard job i totally agree but for somebody with trekking experience and good condition plus good shoes and trekking poles it is by no means an impossible task i must say i found the descent from the rim to the lake technically much harder due to rotten steps and awkward stones on the path time for repairing the pathi hope the efforts of the national park authorities and responsible trekking companies like ours will soon have a lasting effect and the rubbish problem can be solved for good in a manner suiting the character of the magnificent mount rinjani all trekkers be sure to check beforehand and during the trek that you choose a company wirh ecological responsibility of course bring your own rubbish including toilet paper down as well,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,1,3,0,1,0

5,we did the dn trek from sembalun to senaru and it was an absolutely incredible experience the views from both sembalun and senaru crater rim were stunning as were the views from the summit of mount rinjani the climb to the summit is very very challenging especially the last hour or so where for every step you take you slip back at least one step but it is totally worth it when you get to the top for sunriseit does get cold at night so make sure you have the appropriate clothing guides and porters are amazing and do a fantastic job for youunfortunately there is a lot of rubbish all over this trekking route including human faeces and toilet paper right next to the path as it is a very busy and popular route you do pay a park entry fee and i am not really sure what this goes towards perhaps it could be going towards cleaning up the mountain there are some very easy solutions to get rid of this disgusting eyesore which could ruin some peoples experience drop toilets at the main campsites and pos they have these all over nz without any issues either every group that goes up has to collect a bag of rubbish or send a group up purely to collect bags of rubbish i am sure that any trekker would even be happy to pay an extra tax to fund this fine any company that leave their rubbish have designated areas for compostable food wastethis was a truly magical and incredible experience but the indonesian government need to do more to properly care for such an incredible natural beauty,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,1,3,0,1,0
5,first of all some recommendations to consider before starting the trek buffs its dusty more or less all the way and the sun might furthermore burn quite a bit extra snacks the tour guides do provide you with snacks but it is kept at a minimum compared to what most trekkers would consider appropriate warm clothes if you want to make it all the way to the summit of rinjani you need to bring warm clothes its cold up there and the wind is pretty nasty to be honest gloves are thus almost a necessitya bit about our tripwe were two danish guys who decided to trek rinjani in three days two nights with rinjanisanurutrekkingcom it was simply an amazing trip we had an awesome tour guide with lots of humor and great experience furthermore the porters that carried our food cooked delicious meals also vegetarian both for lunch and dinner there was plenty of water all the way and it is therefore unnecessary to bring water yourself as it can be seen on the attached pictures the view is breathtaking and among other things it feels special to see both a sunrise and a sunset in the same daywe could not have asked for more but we should have brought more clothes we wore long pants a sports tshirt and a windbreaker on our way to the top however it would have been nice to have an extra warm sweatshirt or some kind of skiing underwearin short the trek is totally worth the effort and we really recommend going if you want a true adventure we would do it again at any time enjoy,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,3,0,1,0
5,the view from this mountain is magnificent one must climb the mountain to view it personally the trekking would require min dn if you are with a guide eating dust is unavoidable here during the climb the entrance fee is not used by the local authorities to maintain the park though the fee is steep hopefully mt rinjani will have its majestic view for alot more years,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,0,0,1,0
5,it was really a special experience hiking mount rinjani i am not that kind of sporty person who exercise a lot i sometimes jog or do some cardio exercises before i went to this hike i went for a few hikes nearby the area but none are comparable with mount rinjani we took  days package which means that we need to hike for  days we were lucky we actually chose this package though it means that we were dragging the whole trekking activity to even longer and we got more tired due to longer treks we admit that we didnt exercise much before the hike but we totally didnt expect our speed to be this slow that we almost took double or almost double of time compare to others if we had taken the  days package we would definitely be rushing all the time and could not enjoy the view more the views are spectacular the mountain was magnificent you would forget all the difficulties you faced when you are at the top of the mountain overlooking the crater and when you are downhill again by the lake and in the hotspring you tend to forget your body pain and tiredness and i got one of the best sunset views of my life at our camping place for the rd night the food prepared by the tour guide and the team were simple yet fulfilling but the food might be a bit unhygienic one of us actually got something like diarrhea after our first lunch the camping areas were really disgusting its sad to see the condition of the area rubbish everywhere and people just poo everywhere ewww but other than cleanliness and hygiene everything else was good our tour guide even prepared some snacks for us during our hike and please remember to have proper hiking gear and clothings they are really important during hike and when its super cold at night,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,1,3,0,1,0

5,mt rinjanias a whole the volcano is amazing you rarely get a chance to climb an active volcano go inside a calderavolcanic hot springs and camp on a rim that said the trek is very very hard and not for the faint hearted you must be physically fit but most importantly mentally fit most treks are done over  days  nights with a guide and some porters these packages are around  and dont seem to differ even if you pay more you will do around  hours walking on the first day  on the second including the incredibly difficult summit ascent and descent and another m lake descent and ascent then  on the last everyone in my group managed it slowly but it is very tough and definitely book a couple of days to relax afterwards that said the views and sense of achievement you get at the top are worth it all all of the food you will get will be amazing as they want to keep you well fed for all the walking we had fried chicken nasi goreng noodle soup banana pancakes etc i really enjoyed the hot springs after the summit and would highly recommend it if you have the energytipsguides seem to vary greatly and might not fully prepare you for the trekbring warm trousers and a jumper as it gets cold at night also a tried and tested waterproof as you spend a lot of time in the cloud and when it rains it poursmake sure you are always hydrated as this helps the ams and also stamina on the h summit hike our guide gave us around  litres between the  of us and we were severely dehydrated for the whole trek almost not managing notbring snacks  you can buy oreos and beer at the first campsite up the mountain but bring lots of sweets and biscuits to keep youthe team going indonesians believe doing hard hikes on an empty stomach and so we were only fed a few crackers for the  hour walk to the top would also recommend tiger balmmuscle rub antiinflammatory and tissuesbut most importanlty tip and thank your porters lots  your porters do the same hike as you apart from the summit but they are carrying kg on their backs when you arrive at camp at lie down and complain youre tired they are exhausted but they will still run around and pitch the tents roll out the sleeping bags light a camp fire offer you teacoffee and cook you a fresh delicious meal never complaining and all with a smile on their face they sleep without mattressesbags because they give them to the customers and sometimes dont eat the premium foods they do a huge amount behind the scenes  from getting up at am to walk in the pouring rain to refill your bottles with spring water or washing up when it is freezing outside they do all this for under day i would recommend k tip per person per porter and more for the cookanyone who is particularly great,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,3,1,3,0
5,mount rinjani is a breathtaking place we hiked from sembalun as part of a  day  night package the hike each day were challenging especially getting to the summit we did around  hours of hiking which gets tough as the days go on the experience is recommended if you like hiking volcanos and a physical challenge a good level of fitness is recommended as well as warm clothes and good hiking shoes the view from top is the most awesome thing i have ever seen with my own eyes please visit lombok and see it for yourself you will be disappointed by the litter and plastic along the route but dont let this put you off just be mindful not to be part of the problem you will be blown away by how hard the porters work facilitating the tourists up and down the mountain so do give them a tip and eat all the food the carry for you,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,1,3,1,0,0

5,the hike to the summit of rinjani is mystic intense mysterious and at the end beautiful i am so happy we did it but at the same time happy its over i have a tremendous fear of heights so i have been worrying for weeks and preparing by reading all reviews some even scarier than others but rest assured its not that badthe walk up starts at am from base camp and during the  hrs up there is a tense atmosphere people are nervous and the hike is just super heavy especially the end but the moment the sun comes up and you see the summit reaching for you so closeby it gives you tons of energy the view is amazing and climbing rinjani feels like a victorythe walk down is also intense because then you realize what you actually climbed in the middle of the nightreaching base camp at around am you will have breakfast and you can decide to continue the walk or like us decide to cancel your second night because you are already satisfied with what you did and basically every bone in your body hurtsgo for it but try to be fit before you go,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,0,1,3,0
5,this was definitely a difficult trek which i realised only how hard it was while i was on it although saying that the toughest part of it was the summit day while the rest of it was very manageable i was disappointed to see a fair amount of garbage along the entire trail i wish that the guides and porters would take more responsibility in ensuring that nobody leaves garbage behind i would recommend making the time to go on this trek if you can club it with doing other things on lombok island but to go here just for the trek might not make too much sense in my opinionmake sure to have the right gear especially the right shoes as well as the warm clothes it gets very cold at night,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,3,1,0,0
5,you can definitely do this but the key thing is you need to go from senaru not sembalun as of november  the guys at the entrance will let you up without a guide at senaru and will turn you away at sembalun it takes around  hours to get up but be aware that it is steep and a solo hike should only be done by strong and confident hikers the view from the crater rim is exceptional an youll have some great conversations along the way with impresses guides and especially porters with it seeming to be pot luck if you get a decent guide or not i recommend going solo if you can manage it a tent sleeping bag mat etc can be rented very cheaply idr for the lot in senaru make sure you take plenty of water,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,3,0,0,0

5,wow what an amazing experience after reading some horror stories on here about tropis touring company and weather conditions i cant actually tell you which company we used as it wasnt printed on my receipts but i think it was rinjani trekking centre in sengiggi anyway if you are prepared for pain you will experience much gain dont be stupid and rent gear bring your own water proof lightweight jacket flexible hiking pants and spare change of socks and t shirt because you will sweat a lot on the first day and you will want to change your shirt at sunset you hike for  hours with an hour lunch break on the first day its a very hard day i managed the whole trek without poles but i would recommend them for most people we had rain at our lunch break it wasnt great but after some hot food the weather clears and we continued dont forget its now the wet season in indonesia so expect some bad weather we got very lucky and had great weather on the morning to the summit we did the dnight it is an excruciating hike to the summit and only half our group made it but its absolutely worth it incredible views and it was not windy on this day an awesome experience but dont bother if you are not fit and think your just going up there for a nice photo opportunity  its a true test of will the bottom line is whoever you book with dont rely on them for anything except some food and a tent prepare yourself with appropriate clothing and take some extra snacks in your backpack most of all prepare yourself mentally and train for at least  weeks before you go and you will thank yourself,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,0,1,3,0
5,as you might have seen on photos already the climb to mt rinjani is stuffed with beautiful views and vulcanic landscape a friend and i travelled especially for mt rinjani to lombok and it was worth it we did a day hike on the vulcano including the summitwalk at midnightin a nutshell the hike consists of day uphalf a day summit day downbasically if you are relatively fit used to walking  hours upwards  with breaks of course  you will be fine for the  day up and down parts the challenge however lies with the summit trek it is not mandatory but most definitely part of the experience train beforehand so you can make it trust me itll be worth ittips n tricksbe sure to bring a lot of snacks such as energy barswarm clothing is a must especially when trying to reach the top including glovesbooking can be done everywhere around the island my friend and i travelled to the mountain and booked something there on arrival  expecting itll be cheaper than booking at an agency dont do this  we had to pay quite a lot negotiate a good deal at an agency and youll be fine,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,0,1,3,0

5,rinjani is as hard as they say you will hate yourself for signing up while youre climbing but once you reach the campsites and the summit all of your frustrations will fade away because of how gorgeous it isthe first day is very tough the nd day crater rim to the summit is even tougher but your willpower will carry you through and i promise itll be worth it it also really helps to have a lovely group of trekkers that you become quite intimate with very quickly i did the dn trek and after reaching the summit most of my group defected to dn and decided to go down that same day while its cool to continue down to see the lake hot spring and the other side of the crater its not necessary if your main goal is to climb rinjani i dont regret completing the dn but i wouldve been just as happy going right down after summiting in dn i would say its up to you and how you feel after coming down from the summit to decide whether you should go home that night or tough it out for one more dayit is an option to sleep in while other people summit but i found the view from the top to be well worth the hike up and i was so tired from the first day that i had the mentality of i didnt hike all this way to not summit it really is significantly harder and quite a frustrating slippery hike to the top but if you think you can physically do it i highly recommend you doi had a really great experience but i would be careful in choosing a trekking company as there are some nightmare stories going around and some campsites smelled like urine as we passed by i believe mine was rinjani eco trekking but i really have no idea as my airbnb host booked it for me the tents and sleeping bags were wonderful the food was delicious and i surprisingly appreciated the toilet tent much more than i thought i wouldveyes there is a lot of trash which is unfortunate but thats kind of the nature of sea hikes there was no visible human waste in my campsites  they do a really good job of covering up the toilet holes and my porters were really conscious of carrying down all of our trashjust do it you only probably rinjani once,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,3,0,0,0

5,in this review ill try to cover what i would have wanted to know before climbing the summitpreparation do a good mix of stairs and local trails and at least be comfortable carrying a kg load for about  flights of stairs with breaks of course before attempting itmost useful equipment strong headlamp trekking pole shoes with good grip  version from decathlon probably the minimum needed and wind breakerpackage unless youre in great shape i would have preferred either the dn sembalun  sembalun which skips the lake entirely or the dn camp in the lakewhen i did dn i barely had time to enjoy the lake when i had to go up to the other crater rim again afternoons are cloudy so we didnt see a nice sunset on the nd evening and our camp site was so far down the rim we didnt see sunrise the rd day either all in all the extra  day climbing to senaru felt kind of pointless and very tiringhowever is the climb worth it very godspeed,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,0,0,3,0
5,the hike up the mountain was wonderful and the sunsets and sunrise was breathtaking it was not an easy hike due the the volcanic terrain but the sunrise up on the mountain top was the reward my only complain was the litter at the various campsites it is sad to see such a beautiful mountain littered by inconsiderate climbers and local pottersguides the park should be stricter in their enforcement to ensure that cleanliness is maintained in the mountain,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,1,0,0,3,0
5,definitely worth visiting even if you arent doing the full trek we only went up to the crater rim but it was brillianta few tips and tricks for the trip dont take this trek lightly it is hard you need a good base level of fitness to do this and you dont want to get stuck half way up climbing mountains is difficult and you should not underestimate this make sure you have the right kit hiking boots or shoes with good grip are essential i would recommend walking poles as well as it can get super steep in parts take a decent jacket with you a hat and sunscreen be weary of the guides and what they tell you that you can do really make sure youre comfortable with what youre about to take on there are limited or in our case no safety briefings before the hike so you really need to do your researchoverall the guides and porters are fantastic and will help you get up and down the mountain as best you can but just dont think this will be a walk in the park the view at the top is senstational and if you can get there well worth the hike,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,3,0,3,0
5,the place is magical we did a dn hike with cakrawala they were great making the hikingcamping experience unforgettablehere is what i think we went up from sembalun and down to senaru anyone reasonable fit can do it expect big crowds during high season especially at sembalun camp site there were a few hundred tents when we were there if it is too taxing for your you dont need to hike the last part to summit to enjoy magnificent views crater view at sembalun camp site in my opinion is already breathtaking try reaching the sembalun camp site together with your team with sky getting dark and weather turning cold searching for your team in the dark can be quite challenging we saw many frustrating hikers doing that have a warm jacket and torch light with you in case you reach sembalun camp site late and separated from your team keeps you warm until you find them soaking at the hot spring near segara anak lake is a must in my opinion it is really refreshing if you are camping next to segara anak lake make sure you dont rush and leave too early the morning view of the lake is postcard perfect we saw a few teams left when it was still dark they dont know what they are missing if you are coming from sembalun camp site to spend a night next to segara anak lake ask your guide to move a little pass the main camp ground to the next bay to set up your tent it is much more quieter there with less rubbish floating on the lake views from senaru rim is breathtaking as well yes there is rubbish everywhere just have to overlook it and enjoy the journeyrinjani is definitely the gem of lombok anyone visiting lombok should seriously consider including the hike in their itinerary,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,1,3,0,3,0

5,definitely worth visiting even if you arent doing the full trek to the summit there are plenty of great hikes and things to see even if you dont go the whole way as others have said getting to the summit is a challengeif you have never climbed a mountain before then you seriously need to reconsider your decision to go all the way to the summit if you think you can make it because a brochure or local guiding company tells you you can do itclimbing mountains is hardyou need mental stamina endurance and quality gear you can not expect to do this comfortably because you work out a the gym a few times a week and have a pair of sneakers and a waterproof jacket with youlocals have been climbing this mountain all their lives and most have never been outside lombok let alone indonesia so they really have no idea how unfit and unprepared most people are to tackle this challengehealth and safety is also not really considered that much anywhere in indonesia  every outdoor activity we did during our  week trip across the country with a guide inevitably involved a conversation about how some foreigner had recently killed themselves because they went far too far outside their comfort zonesthe rinjani story involved a foreigner who jumped off one of the wellknown waterfalls because a guide encouraged him to do so  he didnt know how to swim and drowned when he got trapped at the base of the fallshis guide also died trying to rescue himsobering stuffso  yeah the local guides are very kind and experienced but just keep in mind  they have no context for your ability or lack of it and they simply dont have any training or understanding of health and safety in the way westerners dodont take your decisions in the outdoors lightlyknow your limits and stick within themclimb a mountain like this only when you have the skills confidence and gear to do it safely and comfortably,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,3,0,0,0
5,its not easy but with determination and not making it on time to see the sunrise you can make it to the top by hiking slowly a pace at a time with walking sticks and proper shoes keep warm and something to cover up if you are slow as the sun will burn youtie your shoes lace properly coming down as you yr toes will hit the front of the shoe by the constant lugging forward on the long step downward walkits worth to reach the top so dont give up good luck,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,0,1,3,0

5,strenuous trekthe trek is amazing and worth of every step but is really strenuous and more than average fitness level is required it is also mental matter as you need strength of will to reach the summit the trek is really steep and slipper from the summit or rims there are stunning views during the sunrise or sunseti did dn program it means first day trekkingclimbing for  hours with some breaks second day the most hardest one you wake up at  for  to  hours climb up to the summit and back in about  hours after the breakfast  hours trek down from the rim to the lake where you have lunch and bath in a small thermal stream and then a final climb to the rim for about  hours  day just trekking down for about  hours nevertheless still hard as your legs are already tiredto choose the trekking company depends on your budget the program is the same at all operators the difference is in luxury during your trek bigger tents thicker matrasses chairs and the qualityvariety of meals while on the trek i could notice that the companies usually serve different meals and are not monotonous as some people mention from my experience is more important the party you are with especially if there are people with quite considerable fitness level difference when you book the trek nobody ask you how fit you are or explain to you in more details how gruelling the climb is and especially how hard the second day of the trekking can be trekking from am to  pm for me this is really bigger concern then the service during the trek just give your example our group had to finely split the second day after pushing our porter not the guide who we did not see as accompanied the boy who was permanently far behind the first day when we got to the rim at pm he came at  pm very hard to climb at nightdark second day after the summit climb ha was  hours behind with still about    hours climb ahead for us this would mean that our group would have to stay at the lake not at the crater rimas far as the environment is concerned around the camp sites you will see some pollution but our company and also others as far as i could see cleaned after themselves porters or guides carry rubbish bagsimport stuff to take or infotake walking poles will be really handyheadlamptorchsunscreenwater proof jacket for rainy dayswarm jacket and gloves for the morning summit climbwater bottle  it can be refill from the streamsgood spiritps tip your porter they do a great job during the trek,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,3,1,0,0

5,definitely one of my favourite experiences in indonesia we did the  day hike which is not to be considered easy but  worth it my only criticism is that considering rinjani is a national park there was a lot of litter and was not very looked after well due to many campers  bit of a shame to see such a beautiful area not truly appreciated would love to do it again one day but this time bring proper walking shoes we proved it was possible in trainers if you want to fall over loads,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,1,0,0,0,1
5,prepare yourself for a long winding drive motorcycles are not really up to the steep slope unless new and highly recommend renting a car the transition from coastal jungle to mountain rainforest is gradual yet total and at some point you become awed by the majestic trees dense overlapping layers of the canopy and the sheer steepness of the climb monkeys abound the lower levels and along the road and there are numerous photo opportunitird the air is pure and the temperature drops remarkably so bring layered clothing or at least a good rain jacket it was cloudy and raining at the summit so i missed the views yet the air the jungle and the experience is something i will remember forever,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,0,1,3,0
5,i will never forgot with this experience because the volcano exploded while we were on top of the mountain the warm volcano ash just splashed to your face no place to run and hide just pray nothing worst would happen we only hiding at behind a big rock while cant see anything clearly this is surely one of the best experience,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,0,0,3,0

5,really tough but so so beautiful and an incredible experience stay for at least  nights if you can it would be such a shame just to go to get to the summit and go back down without spending more time there it is beautiful there are a lot of tourists this is actually not a problem and nice as youll see a bunch of people throughout and everyones very encouraging and supportive however people complain a lot about the litter yes there can be a lot of rubbish left around however people dont realise that in indonesia people are not educated on conservation nor is it their first priority  if you dont like it pick up the litter yourself to show them,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,1,0,0,3,3
5,i did the dn summit trek starting at sembalun a couple of days ago and it was amazing its true that its a tough hike but anyone who is somewhat fit can make it it may take you  or  hours longer to get to the summit so you should leave earlier if you think its going to take you longer for reference my girlfriend is a couch potato and she never does any sports and she still made it without any preparations i had to motivate her a lot but she managed to do it if you have enough perseverance you will be fine the problem was that we were too late for sunrise so if youre still on the fence do it but if you want to get to the summit before sunrise then you may need to wake up earlier so you have a head start it is also true that there is a lot of rubbish but the rubbish is mostly at the campsites outside of the campsites it is not that bad my advice is to bring good hiking shoes i did it on sneakers which was great until you get closer to the summit when you really need more grip and i was really struggling with the lack of grip you also have to bring a torch or headlight and some warm clothes it can get really cold and windy at the summit around  degrees celcius you get enough food during the tours but its not a bad idea to bring some energy bars or snickers last advice is to take a tour that starts from sembalun the biggest difference is that descending towards senaru is much easier because it is more gradual when your knees are not so fresh anymore,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam,0,3,0,3,0

1,if i could rate less than  i totally would we were really looking forward to travelling to gili t however we were extremely disappointed by the time we arrived we had read about the boat trip onto the island so we knew that was going to be a bit of a bad journey which was ok however once we arrived to the island it sadly looked like the slums its a shame that these people are made to live in such poor conditions the only way to get around on the island is by cycling which is ok or by horse which i thought would be fine to until i saw how they were treated we had about kgs of luggage with us due to travelling across bali and dubai during our trip they chucked this on to a carriage alongside us both and the rider themselves as a couple we only weigh about kg however that on top of the luggage you could see that this was hurting the horses back however you could not drag your suitcases to the resort due to the poor conditions of the road we then saw that even when the horses are not transported they arent even allowed to sit down constantly carrying their rider laying down on the back of the carriage connected to their back we stayed at the kaleydo villas which were lovely they offered free bicycle hire and snorkelling hire which was really helpful however the second you walked out of the resort it was like you had entered another world gili is definitely the australian version of magaluf if you were travelling there for this purpose you would probably have a good time we did however find a newly opened beach club called skinny dip which was much cleaner nicer and more our style i think if the island had more of these places and looked after their own this would be a much nicer place to travel the sand was white on the beach and the water was clear blue which was nice to see however the coral was dead and the snorkelling in egypt is a much better experience during our journey back on the boat scammers were allowed onto the boat from the staff that drove the boat to and from the island when we had arrived back to mainland bali they say that they work for the shuttle bus company and snatch everyones bus tickets from their hands which forces travellers to get a taxi from someone that they work with they were very rude and aggressive pushing people over to get past considering this is such a run down area that only survives from tourism they should have more respect and consideration for their tourists we will definitely not return to any of the gili islands and will be advising everyone we know against travelling there,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam,0,3,1,0,0
1,we visited this island with a really high expectations however this has been one of the worst experiences in my life read below to understand the ratingwe decided to hire a tour to discover the  islands and do some snorkeling with the company agus gili bahari i dont want to highlight the details but during the excursion a man died drownedthe island does not have the necessary resources to meet the minimum emergency and none of the staff working on the island has the necessary knowledge or resources the man who died was attended by spaniards french british and australian i really wish you the best of times in the gili but i just want to tell you that if something serious happens you are totally doomed besides that i want to draw your attention to the kind of tourism you are going to find in these islands for the locals you are simply money after the man died the only thing they asked me was if he wore a life jacket so they could recover iti also want to highlight the unsustainable tourism of the islands the center of the island is literally a landfill and does not resemble what you see in the photos in the holiday agencies if you expect to see corals or life under the water i just want to tell you that all the corals are deadthe conclusion is if you really want to collaborate in this kind of tourism and just want to use this review to show a small part of what does not talk about these islands,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam,1,1,1,0,0

1,we were recommended to visit the gili islands by a number of people one described gili t as paradise we were shocked to find that it is anything but the amount of litter and mess here is appaling nobody is looking after this island and it is a great shame we walked around the island expecting that away from the busy bars and restaurants the island would become more idylic when in actual fact it gets worse and worse it is not beautiful or paradise in the slightest absolutely not worth the long journey to get here the only places that i have enjoyed on the island are the santi resort ponte villas and pearl or trewangan which are all close to each other very disappointed and would definitely not recommend a visit here it is also sad to see the horses pulling carts around with lazy tourists in its very hot for them and they didnt have watersome were lame we also saw horses being forced to go in the sea up to their necks in water just for someone to collect an inflatable flamingo the horse was trying to turn around but was hit and hit not my image of paradise,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam,1,1,0,0,0

1,i visited this island in  during my travels around asia and was one of my favourite places however im afraid gili t has taken a massive turn for the worse lets start with that horrible overheated lung wrenching fume filled boat from the bali mainland overpriced and not nice at all gili t itself was hit by a  earthquake in  and simply has not recovered buildings have turned to a pile of rubble and those that are still standing seem to be on their last legs litter is everywhere all over the island whether it be on the beach in the sea or into the centre you cant help but get annoyed at something that should be dealt with it seems tourism became too much for this small island i have read other reviews on gili t with people saying how the horse drawn carriages on the island are great to reduce noise and air pollution these reviews left me baffled at how people think horse drawn carriages are the answer what i seen was animals being abused while working in the baking hot sun without any water food or shade i felt physically sick every time i seen one what i would say is yes gili t is great if you want a party even to see turtles and grab a sunset pic on the famous swings however apart from that gili t left me sad knowing that the environment local people and animals are the ones suffering my second and last time to the unsustainable gili t,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam,1,1,1,0,0

1,while gili t itself is quite pretty with beautiful beaches i could not get passed the extreme animal cruelty the only means of transport in all of the gili islands is bike or horse and the horses are actually a single small pony carrying loads of often  people and luggage whipped and beaten underfed etc a quick google will give you all the facts we only stayed for three days and while id love to come back i simply wont until the island considers a more sustainable form of transport solar powered tuk tuks have been proposed,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam,0,1,0,0,0

2,gili t has the makings of a successful holiday island but the reality is a situation of dying corals due to global warming and earthquakes and over populated snorkeling spots fishes are scared away by the numerous number of boats even in off peak season and poor planningthe touted party island probably got its name from the countless number of drug dealers offering their product as nightfalls the clubs are dismal bad music although theres no cover chargethe island does serve drinks that are stronger so cheap drinks is a plus herethis island isnt expensive its probably pretty affordable if you book your hotels in advance but if youre tight for time you could give this island a pass,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam,0,0,2,1,1
2,alas me being here does not help but i came to these islands in  and the difference now is unbelievable you can now cycle all the way around and there is hardly a single area that is not built on bars and dive huts and boats and people are everywhere this has led to the entire coast line having around  foot of dead coral to cross before you see the fish the turtles are still here but the other wildlife is dwindlingfreshly caught fish is now at an absolute minimum with the vast majority being shipped in frozen from lombok the only fresh caught fish was baby lobster and prawns please do not eat these as it will only encourage the depletion of these stocks furtherthat said there are still turtles here  they return to the same beaches every year to lay eggs and fish to swim with when you swim out far enough and i am sure for a party island this is great to be aton the whole though it is dreadfully sad to see and i imagine within the next  years this island and the close by g air  g meno will be destroyed by over tourism,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam,0,1,0,1,0

2,the gili islands used to be beautiful but they have been destroyed by their own success the daily boats from bali deliver people to these islands and there seems to be no oversight or thought to the environmental degradation that is occurring the once pristine reefs were filled with fish and colorful coral and you could simply swim out from the beach and snorkel now the coral is mostly brown or bleached white boats anchor everywhere the fish are mostly gone the saddest part though is the garbage just beyond the wall that separates the main road trash has been piled up the beaches are okay but its busy with a lot of people on bicycles that are not necessarily driving sober i saw a couple of accidents if you want to party this is the place to do it further away from the port it is quieter but not necessarily cleaner there are plenty of dive shops restaurants and bars but they have failed to restrain development and its a bit of a mess i was here many years ago before it had been discovered and it was so lovely but its been overfished its not paradise lost but paradise has been found also this island sustained some pretty heavy earthquake damage so the clean up and rebuilding are ongoing you can still snorkel from the beach and im sure the dive shops have special spots but i would not recommend this island,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam,2,0,0,0,1

3,i stayed in gili t for  days and while its beautiful it did not me my expectations beach wise if you are interested in diving and snorkeling than this is definitely for you that is the main activity its marketed everywhere on the island and the waters are amazing other than that its just spas western restaurants and beach this is fine except the beaches have tons and tons of coral and broken coral everywhere you simply cannot walk on the sand without shoes even in the water its there along with kelp and algae i really wanted to just be a beach bum for a few days but it was ruined by all the coral i even went to the other side of the island which was worse because it has rocks and coral there are also way too many horse carts constantly going up and down the main strip where all the tourists stay it is a small island where you can walk or bike no need for horse carts there are bicycle rentals everywhere if you dont want to walk around plenty of western restaurants not much local food missing was adequate places to find beverages it is a very hot place with not much shade so you constantly need water but the few marts that keep water and soda are not enough for the climate you dont walk into restaurants in the daytime just to buy water if your interested in diving snorkeling or taking boat rides definitely go but if you want soft sand beaches skip it and go to kuta lombok where they have great beaches,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam,0,0,1,0,0

3,an easy island escape from bali no motorized vehicles in the island the main mode of transportation is bike walk or the horse buggy we did find the horses to mistreated so that was sad to see the main drag is busting with lounge bars greenhouses and restaurants you can bike around the island and will take you a good hour or two it gets very crowded with at time popular with the backpackers crowd if you are into water sports snorkeling diving then the island has a lot to offer otherwise not much to do and see,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam,0,0,1,3,1

3,we visited gili t as part of a month holidayhoneymoon around thailand and bali weather was great food an drink was cheap and the island itself is really nice it just wasnt what i had been told it was by friends who had been there previously i know there was an earthquake last year which has probably played its part its a nice island with some good bars restaurants and beaches but for the travelling it takes to get there i would give it a miss next time probably also we have woke up this morning to a text message off our bank we used a credit card for our whole trip just for insurance purposes and while we was staying in gili we tried to take money out of an atm one morning we had previously had no problem using atms on the island but this particular morning it processed the transaction without giving us our cash the money was credited back to our account so we thought nothing of it but this morning someone had tried to make  transactions from our account after speaking to the bank they have told us our card has been cloned by the atm machine and someone has now been trying to withdraw money if this happens make sure you contact your bank asap and keep an eye on your online banking or transactions luckily enough our bank recognised it as fraud and didnt allow the withdrawal and have cancelled the card all in all a nice island and a good part of our trip but that makes the experience a little bit sour now,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam,0,1,0,0,0

4,it has a reputation for being the party island out of the three gilis but thats party with a small p considering some places ive been to south east asia as far as i could see the party was on one small stretch on the south east coast of the island and involved five nightclubs and a once weekly pub crawl that was excellently policed there are no motorised vehicles on the island and so getting around is by bike or the terribly overpriced horse and cart before alighting check out how the animal is treated is it panting so much that it shouldnt take another ride is it sweating profusely does it have blisters and sores where the leather attaches under the belly  the driver of cart number  should be locked up his horse had a weeping wound whilst no bikes or cars keeps one sort of noise down you will still likely have cockerels and a mosque if sung well the call to prayer is beautiful the south west is the best part of the beach to relax and snorkle  that said the beaches arent drop dead gorgeous and you do have to traverse some corral to get to the water depending on the tides you can get cheap snorkle trips to some great places including turtle point where youll see the aforementioned turtle some really great restaurants and accommodation for all levels nice,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam,0,0,1,1,0

5,we travelled all of the gili islands back in  and decided to return in  as we got engaged here previously needless to say that development on trawangan has continued albeit slowed by the  earthquake we opted to stay on trawangan and visit air whilst snorkeling as it made for a great base we stayed on the chilled sunset side which was the best for us knowing we could cycle to the main town at any time quite quickly it is great to see that the island is starting to respect itself in terms of identity care and ecological issues top tips take in the sunset on a clear day that will include views of mt agung on bali go snorkeling there are many trips to take our you can do it yourself but the locals seem to know the turtle hotspots walk to the summit its only m high but you get some good views over air and meno it is also mostly shaded buy something from hawkers im not normally for this but some goods are hand made and they are nice people up for a chat eat indonesian so many of the restaurants now pander to the west with pizza tacos etc etc but indonesian food is deliciouswe really enjoyed returning and may be back one day but until then there are many other places on our list,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam,0,3,3,3,0

5,this is a beautiful island that offers high to low end accommodations and dining on the bustling east side you have many many bars and restaurants many people and many shops on the west side things are most spread out and seemingly more relaxed the west side can get busy at sunset but afterwards should die down you can easily walk or bike around the island booking may be a bit more difficult as not the entire path is paved some parts the sand is too thick to ride through so you must get off and walk the horse carts were a bit annoying with their bells and horns especially since i have heard of abuse to the horses ny the drivers and seeing so many people supporting this type of transportation the only transportation on the island since cars are not allowed also i think the majority of residents on the island are muslim i may he wrong on the religion and because of that there is prayer of the island pa system multiple times of day including  am it woke me up everyday i was on the island but thankfully it only lasts for about  minutes i suggest eating at the night market at least once and getting a pizza at regina pizzeria having drinks at santi lounge restaurant and breakfast or lunch at hello capitano if you are looking for a place to stay i suggest kalua boutique bungalows a bit pricy for the island but definitely worth it,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam,0,3,2,3,0

1,so me and my girlfriend went to this beach it was very beautiful and we looked forward spending the day here we rented sun beds and a surfboard from this guy for in total of k idr fair this was my first time surfing so i wiped out a couple of times but suddenly a bigger wave hit the board and the board split in half so i went back to where i rented it on the beach and explained what happened he then told me that this never happens even though i saw a guy just minutes after with exact same split as mine and that i had jumped on it and so on and told me to pay him  idr but i refused because he never told me that i had to pay anything in case it breaks not until it actually broke then he got very angry and started to threaten me and saying that i had a problem with him i stood my ground and did not want to pay anything so we walked away then the guy follow us by bike and said we should go to the police and figure this out and i agreed to that because i hoped the police could help us out of this scam we came to a conclusion of us paying him  idr for the broken board and that was it but the police could not speak any english so this was of course only an advantage to the beach trader i want to warn everyone to be very skeptical when renting boards directly from this beach because there is obviously some sort of scam going on here where they rent bad quality boards without telling you that you should pay if it breaks and then demands a huge amount of money for the broken board anyway its a beautiful beach just be sure to talk about what happens if the board breaks,Selong Belanak Beach,NTB,Alam,0,1,0,0,0

4,resort is beautiful modern and clean staff were great and very helpful when we had a small problem pools are awesome great views from most rooms and breakfast was also good although no bacon negatives are some of the linen as in towels old and sometimes it seemed it was dirty but im hoping it wasnt prices for drinks were exorbitant for example  large bintang at bar was  approx  and next door at a small restaurant they were  approx so very big difference  so in fact its much cheaper to drink a bintang in australia and dare not ask for a whiskey food also pricey but you can go next door at nufsaid warung or down the road for cheaper meals a very quiet area with not a lot happening so if thats what your after thats very good place but if you want excitement its maybe not for you try maybe gili trawangan,Katamaran Hotel & Resort,NTB,Urban,3,3,0,3,0

4,very friendly and professional staff is this places greatest asset the hotel deserves a praise for its stylish interior and decor as well as tasteful fixtures and fittingsthe senggigi beach by which the hotel is directly located may not necessarily be the most gorgeous in the world its nice though pictures uploaded for you to judge i wasnt too impressed the rest of the island is even less impressiveto those arriving  departing by plane i definitely recommend airport pickup dropoff service offered by the hotel very reliable and reasonably pricedone of the things i didnt like is an irritating habit of leaving your used cutlery on the napkin instead of bringing a fresh fork and knife it only makes the napkin impossible to use and begs a question why you are supposed to eat your pineapple with a fork doused in ketchup and animal fat from your sausage,Katamaran Hotel & Resort,NTB,Urban,0,3,3,2,0

4,would highly recommend the katamaran as a base while in lombok it is a aud blue taxi ride just north of the main strip of senggigi which gives you the convenience of all that is offer in the main tourist area but the seclusion and quiet of being just outside the hotel was clean and efficient with friendly staff the beds were comfortable not too hard as is often the case in asia usual feather pillow options the rooms are large and well laid out we had a standard room  which i think was perfect it was on the southern wing first floor closest to the beachpool except for the end suite with bath being on the south side meant you were further away from breakfastdinner noise in main restaurant and generally had the quieter pool to yourself this pool has a,Katamaran Hotel & Resort,NTB,Urban,3,3,0,3,0
4,we booked three nights at the katamaran and it was really worth it everything was clean except the towels and the bedsheet one time but they changed it right away the included breakfast was great except the coffee but be prepared there is nothing much around outside the hotel so you have to take a taxi or rent a scooter the only annoying thing is that you have to pay a  tax and a  service charge on everything,Katamaran Hotel & Resort,NTB,Urban,3,3,0,0,0
4,this was our seventh visit to lombok having previously stayed at quinci and jeeva klui last year we found ourselves in the middle of the earthquake so this year was going to be interesting the effects of the quake predictably could still be seen especially in sengiggi which was looking shabby that said the people of lombok were as usual friendly and hospitable katamaran showed no visible affects and was immaculate our room had a balcony overlooking the main pool and beachit was clean and contemporary with a great view because it overlooked the pool and sunbeds it was also noisy on the balcony only a sun lounger was provided so if both of us wanted to enjoy a drink together we had to organise an additional chair if one had a similar room on the ground floor ones view,Katamaran Hotel & Resort,NTB,Urban,0,3,0,3,0

5,firstly id like to apologise for the super late review my wife and i stayed at this resort back in october  and our experience here was lovely we were welcomed warmly upon our arrival as we have now become accustomed when visiting this part of indonesia ie bali lombok and surrounding islands and regions the staff at the concierge desk were very kind and professional as busy as they were at the time they were processing many arriving and departing guests at the same time they eventually got to us promptly enough we stayed in a premier king room on the ground floor right around the corner from the main lobby where the concierge desk is located and this was perfect as it provided quick access to concierge when needed the room itself was perfect for us it was big clean and had all the facilities one could ever hope for on an island like lombok the grounds are well landscaped and maintained the pools are clean and are set overlooking the beautiful lombok beach shore the restaurant setting is gorgeous and the food is on point for a hotel of this price point the food on offer never left us wanting menu prices were fair the breakfast buffet was amazing with a large number of quality options available one concierge in particular who i cannot speak highly of was yadi yadi  wow what can i say you are a real special person with a big heart and an incredible work ethic my wife and i are so grateful for your commitment in ensuring that our stay was a memorable one your knowledge of the island helped us immensely and allowed us to explore it safely and confidently thank you so much for your dedication in making our stay one to remember and we hope to be back there again very soon and lastly id like to counter some of the complaints that i have read in some of the reviews for this resort please be gracious in acknowledging that the staff working diligently to serve you are just people like you and i they are not perfect and neither are we travelling around the island will provide glimpses of the devastation the people of lombok have experienced with the most recent of earthquakes and continue to recover from to this day most of these people have families and are doing it much tougher than many of us will ever know please be a little bit more accepting of little mistakes or oversights that may occur until we meet again much love to all at the katamaran resort,Katamaran Hotel & Resort,NTB,Urban,0,3,0,3,3

3,the best thing about this hotel is the location the grounds are absolutely stunnng and it is very peaceful it is located right on the beach and the snorkelling at the beach front is excellent very close to restaurants and shopswe stayed in garden rooms  and  the rooms are dated which i normally dont mind however they dont seem to do any maintenance on the rooms our bed was terrible and i could feel the springs poking through and there was a depression on one side of the mattress a bad mattress is a deal breaker for me one of our rooms had a musty smell that just wouldnt go away the fridge made a buzzing sound so we had to pull it out at the power point the reception on the televisions was pooralso they wanted ridiculous prices for the activites and the items that you could hire   to hire a snorkel for the day overall i feel the hotel room rate is too expensive for what you get,Kila Senggigi Beach Lombok,NTB,Urban,0,0,3,1,0
3,stayed  weeks in july  loved the resort  snorkeling beaches nearbybreakfast was good but repititous needs more variety but staff were terrific reception staff were friendly but messed up our booking and caused us to leave a week earlier than we had plannedas in most of indonesia english isnt the first language and misunderstandings can occurit was a costly mistake for us as all our flights had to be redoneapart from that hiccup it was a very relaxing and enjoyable stay,Kila Senggigi Beach Lombok,NTB,Urban,0,3,0,0,0
3,this was the second hotel of our  hotel honeymoon and honestly was a total disappointment the room itself was fine if slightly small and the grounds of the hotel are very nice but everything else is a let down at breakfast every single paper tablecloth was dirty the toilet in our bathroom was leaking which we reported and although it did seem to slightly improve after that it wasnt ever completely fixed the staff at breakfast and at the restaurant and the bar were lovely but the staff at reception were not hugely welcoming also we were scammed by a local travel agent who we ended up having a heated discussion with in the reception area but none of the staff offered any assistance and it was clear they all know the agent personally at the end we couldnt wait to get off of lombok,Kila Senggigi Beach Lombok,NTB,Urban,0,1,0,1,0

3,my husband and me coming to lombok will be on vacation for a few days we checked into this hotel because we thought that this hotel was beautiful and comfortable and yeepnot my thoughts were wrong about that nice places the food was good and not so prizies or expensive but the things that made us me and husband get dissapointed that we couldnt take our friend to the pool to swim even though we guessed here we really dont know why and the staff did not give us a specific reason why we could not bring friends to swim well  we were very upset and maybe we didnt come to this htl again and this was the first time we checked into this hotelso dissapointing,Kila Senggigi Beach Lombok,NTB,Urban,0,0,3,0,0

3,the kila has beautifully manicured gardens and seem to take pride in keeping their resort well maintained we booked a bungalow room with a beach view i admit we booked one of the last bungalows left but were given a bungalow with a view of the restaurant which blocked our view to the sea it also meant the live band that played there every night was literally like they were playing in your room as there is no sound proofing whatsoever disappointing but not a deal breaker for us plus we got really good at guessing their song lineup haha the room itself was good nice bed great patio area to hang out on but the bathroom left much to be desired while the bathroom was fine and did the job we did expect a little more for what we paid for its a bit run down and the shower head was literally just a stream of water like a tap sometimes the toilet didnt flush properlythe buffet breakfast was pretty standard with some nice indonesian food on offer fresh fruit and some delicious pancakes however you had to be careful not to go to the breakfast too late or they ran out of some of the food their pastries were pretty dry and bland so we didnt really bother but they made great omelettes and even had some nice bircher muesli the hotel restaurant was surprisingly italian which is a little disappointing because wed prefer to eat the local food the food was quite over priced considering how small the portions were nevertheless a nice spot to sit and enjoy the beach and people watchingotherwise the staff were always friendly and welcoming to us and overall we had a very enjoyable stay the pool area was nice and we also enjoyed lounging over near the beach as well the beach had some nice snorkelling that is worth doing if you have the time as the hotel hires out snorkelling gear by the hour the location was great too  right near the main strip of shops in sengiggi which allowed us to explore the local food and shops,Kila Senggigi Beach Lombok,NTB,Urban,0,3,0,1,0
