4.0,this is a fabulously well setup area but despite being offseason here the tourists flicking through ovs including ourselves way exceeded monkeys every photo opportunity has numerous people boggling for prime positiondespite warnings and others experiences there was not the slightest risk of a monkey coming within arms length of you let alone clambering on you and stealing any unsecured items a relief and disappointment bundled into onethe monkeys were very well fed by the attendants and thats pretty much all they were interested in there were quite a few juveniles tussling and some families grooming each other and  defs worth the visit but we found it was overkill removing necklaces and sunglasses prior to entry as these monkeys pretty complacent  it may be their mellow season and perhaps they are more active and cheeky at other times of the year,Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary,Bali,Alam

3.0,stopped at tegalalang rice terrace as part of a local tour very commercialized with swings and photo opportunities for a fee it had rained just before we arrived and the grounds were very muddy and slippery long way to bottom to actually walk in the rice paddies more interesting going through the rice fields on the way here,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
3.0,paris has the eiffel tower japan has mount fuji when you think about a photo that you immediately associate with bali its rice terraces we wanted to see tegalalang during our time in ubud we ended up there as part of a multi destination day tour im glad we didnt hire a driver to take us just to tegalalang or i would have been even more disappointed like ckf said in the review she wrote just prior to mine the commercialization was a huge turn off you have to buy a ticket to basically walk through the little village which is nothing more than a bunch of restaurants and shops trying to sell you stuff the view from the top is the best there are a lot of steps to get to the bottom of the valley and once you are there you realize that the best view was at the top where you started i dont really see the draw of sitting on a swing so we didnt do it you can walk around on a few paths at the bottom but there are even vendors down there trying to sell you tshirts etc the aerial photos of tegalalang and other rice terraces are beautiful and are really iconic symbols of bali but they are usually taken by professional photographers that have waited for the right moment to take the photos like when there are few touristswalking around looking at streets and paths crowded with other tourists was not what we expected,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
2.0,while in bali we knew we wanted to see an authentic rice terrace as they are so beautiful and also experience a jungle swing as it looked fun both popular things to do in ubud i had wanted to go to a wellreviewed rice field quite far from ubud but with our limited time i gave in and we went to tegalalang i should have gone with my guttegalalang was such a disappointment the rice field worker mannequins and the flowy dresses for rent when swinging were so disney and such a huge turnoffthere are several types of swings and we did in fact pay  to swing  swing ride it was nice but very uncomfortable afterwards we started walking in the fields thinking it would be peaceful and scenic but it was so contrived that we turned aroundwe really wish wed gotten better guidance from our guide and insisted on going to the farther less commercial rice terrace our mistake for sure worse a few hours later we visited gunung kawi and found they had a swing there too this one looked much more to our liking and much less touristed wish we had done thatthis was definitely not the right style for us maybe it will be better for you,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam

4.0,the tegalalang rice terrace was our last stop for the day we arrived somewhat after  pm since i had some knee issues our tour agent dropped us at the entrance we were told to wait for him while he parked the van at the parking lot which was further up the roadmany local ubud dwellers have turned to the tourism sector to make a living however quite a few still remain as farmers that is why the tegalalang rice terrace is still in existence producing rice for the balinese  for export market their rice is of high quality tooalso known as ubud rice fields tegalalang rice terrace is located north of ubud the cultural centre of bali it has been cited as a unesco world heritage site  opens  days a week from  am to  pm i believe there is an entrance fee possibly idr but kar had taken care of that for us the best times to visit is probably in the morning or after  pm when there are least number of tourists  when its not so hot also if you want to see the rice terrace at their greenest consider going in the months of march  october as thats when the paddy is about to harvestthe traditional irrigation system is still being used right up to present day according to history it was started in the th century the water comes from surrounding rivers  mountains farmers had built water canals to allow the water to flow from  field to the other the pathway along the rice terrace is also very narrowtegalalang rice terrace is located  metres above sea level thus some might consider the average air temperature of  degrees celsius in the day to be far from comfortablemy partner  i were awed by the breathtaking views of rows  rows of green rice paddy terraces it was indeed natures art we could see the rice terrace from the top right to the bottomapparently giant swings are the current activity attraction in bali we spotted a few in the rice field karr informed that they were quite expensive should i want to try it out i decided not to  opted to take photos with a heartshape prop made of dried trunks towards our left we could see a few restaurants unfortunately they were all closed we also saw the famous love bali signsince it was getting late we decided not to walk in the rice paddy terrace we just marvelled at the beautiful green scenery  left shortly afterwards a trip to tegalalang rice terrace is a must in your itinerary do not miss this stopover,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam

5.0,based on all the photos and youtube vids we knew what wed see and werent disappointed what we didnt expect was the variety of agriculture and the depth of understanding wed gain by going with a driverguide he was able to point out all the other plants also growing there the growing methods for each how the various plots are managed we didnt realize that the terraces are actually compilations of multiple family properties each managing their own sections its definitely worth having a local available to explain how things work and how things are managed at this worldfamous attraction,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam

5.0,we got here at around am as we were visiting bali in peak season and we wanted to beat the crowds when we arrived there was only a small handful of people there and the people manning the bridges and costs were not working yet we did get charged on the way out though which was no problemif you want photographs without hoards of tourists in them get their early they are open  hours a day and so the earlier the betterthe fields are stunning and really pretty to walk aroundthere is also a coffee shop and restaurant near the entrance,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
5.0,words cannot explain how brilliant the design and architecture is for this place  a must see if you are into gardening and farming and all things eco,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
4.0,this is a lovely little spot i asked my driver if there was anywhere to eat near the terraces and of course there was we stopped for lunch overlooking the terracesthe cafes are unsurprisingly a little expensive there is a touristy element to this area but its easily avoided i was told could go for a walk but stay on the same side as the cafe otherwise they will try to charge you i didnt feel there was a need as the spot we were in was quite pretty and i didnt see anything that grabbed my attention on the way in as such i just grabbed a beer sat on a ledge and and took in the beautiful scenery,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
5.0,we woke up early took a scooter and got there before am and was certainly a brilliant idea no entrance fee hardly anyone there  people and got the hazy morning view with sunbeams going over the terraces do it,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
5.0,this is a great place to visit the scenery is just stunning dont forget your camera or you will regret it,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
5.0,the view is exactly the same as what you expect  amazing though some areas have been commercialised with zip lines and swings the large footprint of the rice terraces allows most of it to remain relatively untouchedthe view was incredibly picturesque from all angles do ask your driver to take you to a more obscure entrance to avoid the crowd we were told tour buses starts pouring in after amdont forget to arrange for pickup or have your driver wait for you else hailing a ride would be a nightmare,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam

5.0,these rice fields are just breathtakingly beautiful even though iut has become sort of an instagram spot with all the swings ziplines and photobooth the place itself is stunning,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
4.0,i visited tengalalang rice terraces on a cloudy morning and the weather was just perfect my picture came out very nice though it will never justify being actually there it is indeed a magnificent creation of the almighty godthe only distractions are the zip line and the swing as it makes it difficult to capture a broad view of the whole place in camerai would definitely recommend this place and it is quite accessible also,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
4.0,we loved strolling through the rice terraces a bit of work with the steps and small paths in the heat and humidity but well worth the sweat bring small change for the several money collection points to contribute to the keeping of the paths etc,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
2.0,the problem here is that the locals have now realised what a tourist trap this is and so are exploiting it horrendously you pay a fee for the ticket and then have to walk past a number of restaurants and stores before you get sight of itbecause the view from the road has been blocked what you actually get to see is small in comparison to what it was like a number of years ago,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
5.0,we came here around pm which was great as it wasnt too sunny which wouldve made the place too hot to walk aroundwe parked up on the street at the top you pay just  idr per person and then walk down into the terraces through the cafes there are donation stops as people mention and complain about and it is recommended to donate k per station but i saw some donating around k you have to remember these are rice paddies still owned by people who work on them and so really what is k to walk onto someone elses land that is actually incredibly beautiful and to watch them at work is so interesting including entry fee we paid around k in total for  peoplethats crazy cheap so ignore the its a rip off tourist trap people because the beauty is so cheap yes people want money for photos and swings but why would they be free again its only small donations equivalent to like  or soi would highly recommend to go and see and feel free to speak to the locals working they always welcome with a smile,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
2.0,the rice terraces were pretty and it was interesting to see how rice was grown however it was filled with tourists and people trying to sell things and swings you had to make a donation to walk through the fields donation was more like a payment as they wouldnt let you through without it definitely fun to see but wouldnt bother walking through it just take photos from the top and save yourself the money and the trouble,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
5.0,absolutely loved our visit to the rice terraces so beautiful its a must visit quite a few activities to do and picturesque photo opportunities,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
5.0,this view is breathtaking climbing down was worth it climbing up now thats a different story just take time youll get there on top where the exit never regret to see the marvellous view,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
5.0,an easy bicycle ride from unud through villages and fabulous market towns lunch was one of the best views across the rice fields,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
5.0,one of the less popular rice terraces so there is a chance that there will be crowds of tourists for families with small children they can be a challenge to go through sometimes big steep steps although it seems that the route is not long you can take it easy incredibly juicy green near the pub where you can have lunch overlooking the rice fields,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
3.0,the rice terraces are pretty to take a picture of if you want to enjoy them just go to a cafe at the top or walk along the top and enjoy from there lots of screaming from the swings cheaper than some places to be fair i dont mind the swings being there im just scared of heights the donations at both entry and throughout mean you think youve paid then pay more and more as you walk and it can end up you almost need to pay to get back to the exit if you go to far or get lost one entry fee thats higher to be shared amongst the farming families would be simpler and fairer very busy and touristy and you can see bigger quieter terraces elsewhere pet fake though its good to have one touristy one to leave the others unspoiled so if you want to go for the nature rather than instagram go elsewhere if its just for a gram pic and a quick stop this will tick the boxes as it is still pretty,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
5.0,bit touristy but definitely worthwhile seeing the rice terraces are located in a valley and are a great topic for photos,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
4.0,this really is such a beautiful place to go and check out and walk through it is hard to fathom the agricultural land is so spectacular it is donation entry there are many staged settings for the perfect photos like the bali swing and you will need to pay crazy money for each of them we just took our own photos and still got amazing shots well worth a visit,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
4.0,its spectacular to see and you can see why its a heritage site was a bit touristy but thats to be expected at a place like thisjust dont forget to bring your camera its impossible to take a bad picture of this place ,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
3.0,our driver took us to the terraces at our request another tourist trap but interesting as you walk along the terraces you are asked  and have to donate money for the landowners  before moving along the path locals sit at different levels with baskets of rice for photos the swings are also here above the rice terracesvery photogenic and lush worth a visit but definitely designed for the tourist,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
3.0,we usually try to avoid tourist places but i felt this rice terrace was a must see while you are in bali we got caught by a guy right at the beginning who took advantage of us  took us to his cafe which looked like being at the entrance to the terraceserved us about  kinds of tea for a tasting that we did not want to have at all telling us everything was free lying to us that there is only one exit way from the terrace so we had to go through his shop and so onfinally we were so tired of this hunt on tourists because of course we were not the only ones that we walked only a little and we left this place very soonwe did not like the swings and the spots for paid selfie neitherit would be such a lovely green piece of paradise if only there are no locals thinking all the tourists are walking walletsvery sadhowever there are still so many other rice fields in bali that are non touristy and sooo beautiful,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
5.0,i wasnt bothered about this before we got here as it was part of the days your but it is absolutely beautiful we did the zip wire there as well which was great,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
3.0,this place is beautiful dont get me wrong but it suffers from too many touriststhere are other equivalents around which are just as beautifulthere are a lot of steps involved to if you arent up to climbing in the heat of bali take in the view from the top,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
4.0,we arrived at the terrace approximately  which i recommend or even earlier there was not much shade in the area as you are walking along the route is fairly straightforward although it seems like a maze as you enter there were lots of people going on the swings which is very instagramable but we didnt bother definitely apply a layer of sunscreen with shades and a hat at the ready,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
4.0,must see and visit lot of walking  special retired teenagers could not believe such amazing place in the world ,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
3.0,lets start out and say this place is beautiful it really is it is everything you think it will be albeit very dry at the moment nov  the thing we didnt really prepare for was all the donations there is cash for entry cash for photos cash for the instaswings and then the cash for separate parts of the rice fields that are individually owned  donationswas a good trip to tap onto a visit to the ubud monkey forest as once you walk the fields and have a drink there isnt much more to doit would be great to find some other rice fields that arent over run with tourists,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
3.0,the rice fields are beautiful to walk through but there are so many tourists now who are mostly just there for their instagram posts its so sad to see and theres a lot of disrespect for the land and the people in the pursuit of something instagramworthyin some reviews people talk about not paying donations youre walking through land where people are trying to make a living and the donation is a tiny amount in most currencies so make your own decisionas for the people who say the fields are not longer farmed well youre wrong and if you stayed for more than  mins and or talked to the people who live here youd find that out and learn a lot more,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
5.0,we went to the tegallalang rice terrace to see beautiful view i was wondering how beautiful people taking pictures from instagram google we we went there its beautiful really look amazing to take photo to see rice field outstanding one think make sure dont pay silly money everywhere do research because no one didnt tell us inside rice field you got swing i went to swing other side i paid bali money  people we paid  so its nice but whats the point exactly same swing beautiful view same so dont waste your money,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
4.0,we went to the tegalalang rice terrace to see the amazing view like we saw in the movies and in the pictures on google and its really beautiful indeed when we arrived there we didnt know there was a swing as well and we paid to go single ride its  rupias and the swing for couples is  they have other activities as well like zip line if you want to rent the dress to take amazing pictures is more  rupias i confess that i was not even planning in renting the dress but when i saw the effect on the air with the swing i didnt resist and rented as well if you want to take pictures around they have beautiful seats like the shape of a heart and a bird nest you pay more  rupias  as a donation  just for the picture if you want just to visit the rice fields its free you just go down and walk around just be prepared for the long walk,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
4.0,i went last week and was beyond impressed by the perfect peace and tranquillity of the terraces  a must see whilst in ubud the terraces are so well kept the locals are all so helpful and a small donation to help keep these piece of paradise open for everyone to enjoy is a small token to exchange i arrived and had breakfast over looking the fields it was a pinch me moment  we walk the terraces met some helpful locals and got some incredible photos one of my favourite places in ubud  from me,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
4.0,to go there go with private driver who will wait for you this will not make you rush to visit visit early in the morning and before the tourist tour buses at  am it gets super hot if you go for lunch time and later ask your hostel to book a driver they may have package deals it is difficult to get grab if you may get grab at you hostel to bring at the fields but beware no grab service at the rice fields to come back so either by tour bus or private driveras for the tour entry fee was k rp bring change to donate in some spots expect to trek there it goes up and down its beautiful but it is touristic,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam

5.0,the tegalang rice terrace is a stunning photo opportunity we hired a car and as part of our day trip we stopped off at the rice terrace a donation is requested for entry to the viewing platform we stayed for approximately  minutes that was enough time to take a few selfies and then move on the place can get quite busy with tourists,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
5.0,this was such a beautiful visit it was very hot but that was something beyond our control there were many tourists but the terraces are so big everyone is spread out there are many swings and fun picture opportunities the walk back up the stairs is a great workout,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
5.0,just wow these rice terraces are incredible i went close to sunset and seeing the sun peak thru the trees and shine down on the terraces was beautiful i spent about an hour there walking around and taking photos there is a recommended tip when you enter which is reasonable to help maintain the area seeing as there are many tourists that visita man inside the terraces tried to tell me through hand signals and broken english that we had to tip to cross the bridge but we did not because we already tipped at the beginning not sure if that is a normal thing so just a heads up you may experience that while walking aroundthe swings seemed a bit touristy but fun nonetheless make the trip to come explore these rice terraces when youre in bali,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam

5.0,what a beautiful place on earth if you are in bali go and visit it is worth it they also offer a lot of attractions like a swing flying fox and some instagram picture options like a big heart but you can also just walk around the rice terraces and enjoy the pure feeling of bali,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
3.0,on retrospect being charged an entrance fee to enter a rice terrace was probably the first indication this was a bit of a tourist trap although im sure this once served as a culturally pure agricultural exercise it seems the main harvest these days is coming in on two legs its equipped with most of your stable instagram requirements like the jungle swings and locals holding the basketsthe rice terraces themselves are actually quite nice to look at but there are just so many hoardes of tourists it really takes away from the experiencei think if you want to view rice terraces youre better off going to jatiluwah,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam

4.0,absolutely stunning rice terraces recommend seeing them i think the locals dont actually use it for farming rice anymore rather they just use it for tourists all of the rice field workers are actually just walking around with shoulder baskets and hats for you to try on and have a photo taken with seems like  years ago this wouldve been a real farm but no more there are lots of beautiful real rice paddies all over the island so definitely try and see some real ones in action still beautiful,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
3.0,i am not an instagram influencer but a traveller that loves natures beauty loves to see culture and hear about the existence of a place sad to hear that they dont use the rice there properly its mostly planted for tourists to take photos of the  swings are just there to make money and the place has not much vibe to it but photo freaks love the photo opportunities and back grounds,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
5.0,beautiful place which showcases what ubud is all about the entry is free and theres green everywhere really pretty for photos and to just sap up the local culture its free to enter and walk around but the swings are r a go loads to chose from it was very quiet when we attended on a sunday and there was no queue for the swings i did almost lose my shoe in the mud at one point though and the steps are very very steep and some parts are just mud steps so you need to be fit and mobile to get about all in all it was a nice hour out but dont set aside much more than  hours for this attraction as its not huge and apart from the swing and restaurant theres nothing else to do apart from walk and admire the views,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam

2.0,is the rice terrace beautiful yes but it was also the most inauthentic experience of our entire bali trip we paid a small entrance fee k but no one ever took our tickets probably a scam as we worked our way into the terrace we encountered two different locals blocking the path unless we made a mandatory donation the woman allowed us to pass for k but the next guy was aggressive insisting the fee was k per person we passed for less but not before he hissed a balinese curse on my friend not even kidding if you decide to go consider yourself warned and come prepared with small bills its kind of a tourist trap not to mention all the indonesian children harassing you to buy postcards for their school we couldnt wait to leave,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam

1.0,okay so maybe i got it wrong i got a scooter and went to the ceking rice terraces in tegallalang there was a sign there was a man selling entry tickets maybe that should have been a warning and yes with careful positioning you could just about get a picture with rice terraces that did not have a restaurant on it or a shop or a swing  but the character and sense of space and lush green was to my mind spoilt by total over development now i am going to try again someone i spoke to today said he had found beautiful terraces so they are there just dont go to this commercial bit unless thats what you want if you do end up here you get a better sense of something if you climb down then back up and over the first ridge even there there is holliwood style lettering on one of the little walls of the paddies,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam

3.0,everyone here at the rice terrace was amazing  we even met one very sweet old man whom we bought coconut juice from and the as honestly the highlight of the visit besides the beautiful view and friendly staffvillages these two reasons alone wouldve allowed me to rate this a  unfortunately  i am only giving this  stars because as my friends all girls and i were finding our exit out of the rice terrace  a very rude man would not allow us to pass through without making a donation young man seemed like he was in his ss we then told him that we had already made one in the beginning of the terrace trek he refused to let us pass and put his hand in front of my friends stomach actually touched her  he was very inappropriate and said i was beautiful in an uncomfortable way  we wanted to leave right away so we just have what we had and he said it wasnt enough  as we put more money in to just get out of there  he asked for a kiss on the cheek from me and as we walked away  my friend told me he had touched her butt  of course we wouldnt say anything because we were in a foreign country and just wanted to get out of there asap ,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
5.0,wow this is such a beautiful place you cant come to bali without visiting this rice terracethere are some really stunning views here and great for pictures so many beautiful green coloursit does get really busy here so if you can get here early in the day or after about pm it will be quieteryou dont have to pay to enter but they like you to give a donationthere is also a jungle swing here which is great fun and a good way to see the views but again can get really busyif there are only a few places you visit while you are in bali this is absolute must its beautiful,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
5.0,my friends and i had a great time at the rice fields recently we made sure to get there early  around am before more people arrives and it was a lovely walk we even made friends with one of the ladies working in the field and she gave us some of the rice from the field to try delicious we were also able to buy some of the rice to take home which was very special the colour is really as good as the pictures i would recommend coming here,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
4.0,our family enjoyed the view and also the nice atmosphere the local vendors are also very nice and the weather was good,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
3.0,it was nice as i expected but it seemed too commercial i paid the entrance fee but some others just could go down without fee and there are more local people who asks the fee in the different placesit looked like theres no any rules there are so many swings even a person who asks donationbe careful spend your money,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
1.0,this is a commercial place we wanted to peacefully spend  hours in nature but rather we found someone every  feet along our path selling something to us rides donation etc the rice terrace is not as big as jatiluwih my recommendation would be to skip this place and spend a couple of hours at jatiluwih which is an unesco heritage site,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
5.0,amazing place with alot of adventures and activities we love it really its a lovely place especially for kids the workers are well friendly and and easy to communicate with we will visit again surely,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
5.0,beautiful and definitely worth a visitthe steps are quite steep but you can take shorterlonger routes depending on abilitywe had  children with us ranging from  to  years and it was a good little adventure for them,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
3.0,the rice terrace is slightly disappointing some parts of the land is dried up and withered ive seen a lot more spectacular rice terraces in china a few times the size of thisthe swings zipline zipcycling is a hit for couples they offer dresses rental its quite pretty and you can sit facing outwards plus inwards in two different go to complete your photo album personally not a big fan of these swings thoughtwo mandatory donation points first one prior to entry and another one further down the rice terrace because the land belongs to another family amount for donation is up to visitors,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
5.0,i didnt know what to expect but the rice terrace was absolutely beautiful our driver explained the process which i found very interesting as i didnt know plus there is a circular nest you can get your photo taken on,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
5.0,loved it here looks better in real life than it does in the photos my only caution is for people who have problems with mobility it is quite steep walking up and down the paths you probably need about  mins here to walk around and get some good shots,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
5.0,i spent about hrs here maybe because my friends and i stopped everywhere we could to take pictures there were swings here as there are plenty of swings all over bali my group only paid for entrance and pictures which means youre free to enter the terrace and walk around the entire place no time limits we had a great time beautiful place i felt like my eyes were playing tricks on me,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
4.0,a visit is worthwhile but only if you get up early around  am its just fantastic there take a hotel nearby and not in ubud so you can enjoy the jungle feeling better,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
3.0,there is actually nothing much to do here except taking the swing  which we saw many swings were created for tourist purpose i dont know how much bse we didnt try it taking pictures  you will need lots of patience to get a nice picture a lot of tourists walking around having coffee facing the rice terrace  there are lot of cafe and restaurants surrounding the rice fieldssome entrance will require you to pay idrk to enter we understand from our guide this fee is a form of donation to help the locals there we didnt mind paying the fee it is good to support local industry as best as you can and idrk is not expensive alternatively one can buy local handicrafts from the shops along the way,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
1.0,after doing a lot of research into the best rice terrace walk i was really looking forward to visiting here big mistake this place is like disneyland so fake and a total tourist attraction yes its pretty but purpose built not natural at all if you want a taste of the real thing take a drive into ubud and take a walk through the more peaceful remote and real rice terraces its called kajeng rice fields walk,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
4.0,very cool and beautiful area really great for a tourist activity to walk around the green terraces and take pictures there are also cool little tourist shops along the road they may be a little overpriced but thats part of the tourist experience i supposei would recommend anyone going to try and pair it up with a coffee plantation or other temples in the area that way you maximize your time in the area also be careful with the weather as it can change very quickly and when it rains in baliyou just dont want to get caught outside,Tegalalang Rice Terrace,Bali,Alam
5.0,climbed the mountain on christmas day it was an eventful thrilling and tiring trek yet very rewardingwoke up in the wee hours ard am to prepare started trekking ard am it was pitched dark its good to bring along torchlight or headlight the whole trek took about hrs the sunrise was beautiful breakfast is provided too it was a good morning exercise going down was not bad too option of going down by motorcycle require a fee or walking,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,climbing mount batur was not on our itinerary despite a sunrise hike being the most popular thing to do in the area id read up before our trip and the active volcano seemed reasonably challenging to hike and there was always the problem of us not really having the correct footwear or clothing we decided to enjoy the view from our pool instead whilst staying for a few days in the local area,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,i joined a sunrise trekking tour last yearit was organized by batur volcano guesthouse where i stayed in juneit is one on one guided tourthe price is reasonablethe tour start at very early morningmy guide yoki came to my room and knocked the door to wake me upi was tiredbut after showermy body full of energyi had some simple snacks and followed him to the mountainthe guesthouse location very close to baturyoki very patience and helpfulhe always asked if i am oksometimes he helped me to go upthere are two options to the peak of baturi chose the less harder partit took more longer timeanother option is hardernot easier to climb upbut take less timeafter few hoursi make itbut exhaustedi rest there for a whileyoki cook breakfast for meunfortunetelythe weather not goodalso mistycant see the suriseso sadafter that we went downon the wai took some ohotosyoki helped me a lotafter the touri tipped himthe tour has three routesi chose the second onewhich is medium routebut the weather not goodso i gave upi just followed the same route to back to my guesthouseit is the first route actuallybut i didnt ask for refundcuz it was me want to give uptoo dangerous i thinkso if you want to see the sunrisebetter check the right seasonheard that it is july or augusti think i will try again next time though it is quite challenging for me,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,fabulous place and the veiws were just amazing despite the fact that we got caught in seasonal rain,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,we did this as part of our honeymoon and we couldnt end up with a better guidewe had a great experience on our hike with the fantastic guide karma hes careful safe and will to please a fantastic guy whos always on the lookout for your safetythe only negative experience which weve had was with the drier that picked us up from the hotel at  am from kuta beach because on the way to the mt he took a nap while driving not the best thing to witness so i made sure to ask him open answer questions this way he doesnt fall asleep againother than than the whole experience was beautiful and it is a must you have to make sure you are well equipped when doing itessentials light jacket it is freezy up and you will be sweaty in case you do not have one you could rent from them but it will be idk for it full pants and you could have shorts underneath torch  headlight but the guide will provide one for you anyways water because it is quite expensive on the mt understandable good shoes it is slippery and a high chance of fallingalso i would recommend having an extra shirt that you can change in above in case you do like your sleep it is recommended to leave for the tour from ubud rather than kutaall being said karma is the best guy ever and i suggest if you do this to ask for him hes well worth his pay and i would recommend tipping him at the end because hes not making much on thishave fun and stay safe,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,a mustdo when youre in bali we came during march  so there werent very many people we were told only  people compared to the usual k the hike itself is a bit difficult and slippery due to the small pebbles but get a good guide and youll be okay its definitely a beautiful experience but make sure to bring a jacket for the top of the mountain as it gets cold especially before the sun comes up,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,we didnt expect the temperature to be a low c and the area somewhat obscured by a haze it was still clear enough to enjoy and appreciate the spectacular scenery from various vantage points known to our driver it is still an active volcano no tremors felt or rumbles on the day so it seemed that the gods were happy mounty batur dominates the area two calderas at its base the southern caldera contains a lake and the village of trunyan which is noted for its unusual custom of laying the deceased on the open ground and covering with cloth and bamboo while they decompose the surrounding area has changed greatly since we last visited in  i think that i preferred my visit and the rather primitive facilities that existed then ,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,a hardish trek mainly due to time of the night and humidity and the speed of the guide who wanted to sprint up the views are stunning the monkeys are hilarious and the hawkers and dirt bikers are annoying there were a lot of people up there so it isnt a peaceful place despite the views,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,worthy this strenuous trek is spend a good amount of time on the top and admire the beauty of the nature the sunrise and more we had the best time from the top of the hilltop the sky is still dark and you can only see a few lights in the surrounding villages mount agung  the highest point of bali that had erupted recently in   stands with pride in front of mount batur we did hiking and after all the hard work we just love to see the magnificent view of the sunrise,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,me and my friend went for this mount batur trekking it was surreal and such an amazing experience our trekking guide is very helpful and he is very sweet his name is karma he always make sure that we safe so thanks to him we had really really great experience and enjoyed the magnificent sunrise view very recommended to do this trip when u come to bali,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,one of the best vulcano mountain located in balihere if you do camping you can see sunset and sunrise with the best and beautiful view of another mountain and view of batur leake,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
1.0,its a sunrise on a wayyyy over crowded mountain with cash grabs all along the waydefinitely do another hike if you canthe use of a guide is recently mandatory as wellone positive is that it is a good view of a sunset if you are lucky and monkeys come out at the top to grab food,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,amazing sunrise in bali one of the most beautiful sunrise in the worldit takes around  hours climbing the mountain i think that it was one of the most incredible experience of my life i recommend you to do it,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,what an experience yes it is an early start if you want to see the sunrise but it is definitely worse the climb i am not very fit but you just choose your own pace and the place is definitely very spiritual,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
1.0,mt batur and the lake are very beautiful thats the only positive thing i could say about that place if you want to climb the volcano crater without a guide the locals will stop you and they are not very friendly there is no official entrance fee insurance and any obligation to go with a paid guide this mountain is taken over by a bunch of local criminals rude and aggressive who dont allow visitors to climb on their own without paying a lot of money and probably everyone who pays for a local guide supports that mafia there is no such thing as licensed guide there its surprising how that popular and really beautiful place in bali is under control of unfriendly locals with no any governmental regulations pay or go away and as a result no chance for budget travelers who cant afford paying big amount of money to go there there is no fixed price its all about negotiating and bargaining is that the the official and legal way to climb the mountainonce in the village one will be followed and asked many personal questions will be subject to disturbing bothering offered to buy something or help its not help its just overpriced service so if you decide to go there please be wellinformed and take your decision consciously and wisepersonally i would not advice people on going there unless that unfair and illegal business is regulated by the government or legal institution,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
1.0,i booked my tour on viator for the sunrise trek through the local como bali tour company they are nothing more than a bunch of thieves who care absolutely nothing about you or your safetyi got picked up at my hotel at am and taken to a filthy restaurant for fly infested pancakes and black coffee dont even think about using the bathrooms as i almost vomited from how disgusting they werethen the rain started pouring they charge you  idr to rent a coat and another  idr for a poncho the rain was so bad along with the lightening and thunder that i decided not to go they insisted it was safe and that it wasnt slippery and there was no thunder but thankfully im not blind or deaf and could see they would say anything to you so you would do the treki refused i then got price gouged to take the same taxi that drove me there back to my hotel which was more expensive than the actual tour itselfdont do it they look at foreigners as nothing more than dollar signs and so not care about you your safety or your experience,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,absolutely amazing experience the view from the top of the mountain is stunning the hike is approx  hours and is very steep starting at about the half way mark there are a lot of loose rocks and the volcanic ash makes the hike difficult everyone on the hike appeared to be under the age of  i would not recommend going to the top if you are not good with hiking  it is an intense workout also bring a sweater for the top as it is cool,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,we got a guide and planned for a h hiking with him upfront visiting the place it was super cool and natural they also keep it very clean and neat i loved this place,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,welllets go from startingfirstly find a good group if you dont have a good group to climb and you are sharing your package with a treking company please ask them to adjust you with your age group of people i by mistake got stuck with an old lady and her mom and another girl who havent done trek ever so due to that we were at the last climbing the mountain so when sharing its better to get the same fitness level of trekkers or atleast same age cause guide will not leave the group and let you go alone and taking guide is mustdriver comes to pick you up at the hotel by amam you reach a restaurant for your st breakfast by am and after breakfast the starting point is just  mins drivest breakfast like simple pancake and coffeetea which is included in the trekking package use washroom here cause washroom at starting point is chargeablethey will even pack bread and boiled eggs for you which your guide will give you on the top of mt batur after the climbnow there is a good road till the base of the mountain so its better to pay extra to ask your driver to drop you till the base from where actual climbing starts going on good proper road is good but still it will exhaust you rather you can use that energy on the real tracknow from the place the real track starts its risky so take proper light or light with head strap is good so that your hands are free to hold in case of fallthere are lot of small rocks and volcanic ash which makes the track lot slippery so good treking shoes is recommended and full pants and jacket jacket should not be heavy coz while coming down that same jacket will be heavy as when the sun comes up its get hotnow climb takes approx  hours but since its crowded on the starting so will take lot of time to climb so it will take  hours max even if you are slowyes dont forget to ask the guide the sunrise time so that you climb before thatyes there is option to go on top till the st summit by dirt bike and vijeta charge somewhere from k to k idrand from st summit its another half an hour till the top which is very very slippery due to volcanic ashnow after reaching on the top they will give you two slice of bread and one boiled egg but after sunrise and after resting and relaxing for  mins guides will even try to sell you water and drinks on the top but at very costly price so its better to carry water and drinks you want tonow climbing down is easier and faster but you will find lot of people and its slows your pace still it will not take more than to reach the base on the way you can stop at the cater and this cater is also visible from the toponce you reach the base you can ask your driver to come back to pick you uptipping the guide is good even though you have paid for their fees but they are very greedy sorry to sayafter trek you can visit batur hot water spring which is only  mins drive from the starting point but mention about this to your trekking company before hand only they charge k idr extra which includes ticket inside the hot water spa ticket costs k idryou get towel and locker facility inside with one welcome drink in the packagehot water spring relaxes you fully and you can spend good mins thereon the way back to your hotel in kutasemiyank have a nice sleep in the car  as the drive is for  hours due to trafficessentials light jacket full pants torch  headlight water and energy drink good shoes dont buy water drinks on the top as its very costly so only if neededall the bestdo reply to this comment if my review was helpfulthank you,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,you can choose a   or  hours hiking tour you have to take a guide all are well trained and they know the right paths coming down is more heavy because stones and sand but you guide will help you or he will arrange a ojek,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,valentines day special have you ever imagined what it feels like you and your partner do something that has never existed in bali even more so on the day of a million love valentine with a long duration of time promising for fun activities from the beginning of the pickup at hotels villas etc at  pm while preparing for the trip that goes on  plantation coffee  taking photos in the dive  starting point  climbing to the specified place,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,amazing views from the top takes about two hours to get to the summit plan your visit on a clear day the sunrise is amazing monkies at the top,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,mt batur is one of the valcanos i did not find anything very exciting about it you can stop here enroute hiking might be exciting but we dis not try it,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,one of the best excursion of our indonesia trip trekking to mount batur to view sunrise was adventurous and super exhausting but it was once in lifetime experiencewe had chosen our anniversary date for the trek and it was the best choice ever madetrekking is to mount batur requires decent stamina and some tough terrain specially last  kms so be prepared for the same please note this trek is suitable even for children with  years and above but you need to be very careful while climbingonce you reach top you will have one of the best views of sun mountain clouds and river its absolute surrealand the best thing is boiling eggs in the natural heat coming out of holes of this volcanic mountainits highly recommended for trekkers and nature lovers ensure lot of water stick and umbrella your guide will definitely help but in case your travelling alonewe had a superb guide for this trek,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,waking up at  in the morning and walking up a very steep mountain for  hours may not be everyones cup of tea but if you can this will be a very memorable moment of your bali holiday the sunrise is just awesome and is definitely one of those humbling moments take a light jacket with you as after the climb you will be sweating and it is cold up on the mountain before sunriseto me at years old this is a must to do in bali,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,we decided to do the batur sunrise trekking and we got paired with an excellent guide and a small group of people  in total as a group we had a good laugh and our guide was really fun and nice whilst making sure we stayed safe the sunrise was beautiful to watch and we were taken to see the craters monkeys etc a word of warning  the trek is tough i am a fit person who works out  times a week and have good cardio endurance and i struggled we did so the trek in an hour and a half so would probably be easier if you took longer to get up but the walk is steep and only gets steeper the further you go if you arent fit i wouldnt advise to do it we did manage to get a good price for the package of k idr each which our car operator bali carbali quality tour sorted for us and we werent hassled at all by anyone,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,this place has a beautiful lookout and you can get some great views of the volcano be warned that as soon as you stop there are very aggressive sellers who will bagger you and follow you around so be ready to walk and ignore i did get some lovely pictures from an old man who makes them from volcano ash,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,you must visit this place if you are in bali you will many tour guide to this place and i suggest to book one as they know this place better to get better view for pictures this place is best during sunrise and sunset,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,visited with jata bali trekking guide and tour i really like the place and the whole experience is something which i cant explain in words its a must visit place for its amazing views,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,booked through a hostel when staying in ubud we were a group of back packer friendsthis walk was hard  we asked prior to booking and were told the hike was fairly easy admittedly we are not in tiptop shape but at the same time are fairly averagely healthy  year olds it was hard and it was not overly funthe safety especially when walking down was very questionable and many people had slipped when walking down the volcano the sunrise isnt that impressivethere are no toilets so make sure you go for the number two before you hike or else you will be very uncomfortable when hiking,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,we took the midnight trek upto the peak to see the sunrise we very lucky to be able to see the sun rise from behind mt agung unhindered by clouds the view was quite nice i am dismissive of sunrise and sunset points as i think of them as a gimmick to lure tourists but the midnight trek was fun the trek during the day might get too hot and you may get lost if you go on your own the destination by itself is nothing special the sunrise is like any other sunrise behind a mountain and the sun rises on the day you go like it rises on any other day proper footwear is highly recommended i have weak knees with reconstructed ligaments and i felt the my light trainers offered insufficient grip on the rocks there were people in flip flops though who kept slipping on the rocks but who still managed to make it through the trek i would say hiking shoes are not required but heavy hardy running shoes with a rubber sole meant for running outdoors would be enough go here if you get excited by sunrise views or if youd like to try a trek in the dark,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,the trek was quite intense but we did no research beforehand bring lots of water theres plastic water bottles but we refuse to use them and food get lots of rest and wear comfortable clothes and shoes our guide dante was so amazing so patient with our rest stops so attentive and fun he took pictures for us when we got to the top and always made sure we were doing well and having a good time message me for his whatsapp number if you are planning a trip to mount batur or request him if possible,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,ive been here like i dont know how many times hahaha never been bored here and this is my second review this mountains view is amazing you can see abang right in front of you across the lake agung is a bit hide at the back of abang if youre lucky you can see the legend rinjani everyday if lucky sunrise is beautiful here if you want to enjoy the scenery without many people here i highly recommend you to start the hike around    am or sunset time   pm you can have the top your own ,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,the sunrise trek is a must do we booked through getyourguide and their staff were amazingtheir tour took us up a different route away from the motorbikes that some people complain about and included a stop at some hot springs and a coffee plantation on the way back to our hotel toothe trek itself is fairly intense and requires at least a moderate level of fitness the sunrise at the top is beautiful,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,really enjoyed the early start and sunrise hike quite beautiful to see the sunrise over the clouds definitely recommended,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,i read lots of reviews on here and my husband and i decided to do this trek we are both in our early s and are fairly active at home but not regular hikers we paid  idr each and had a private tour guide pick us up from our hotel if youre staying in the area villa jempana is a stunning place to stay it was a  minute drive to the start of the path and although id read it can take  hours to get to the top we were at the top in just over an hour the walk was tough and had us out of breath but not too bad really our guide was great and we had a couple of rests on the way up to catch our breath again the first half of the walk is definitely tougher than the second half and like others have mentioned the motorbikes taking the less adventurous people up the volcano were really annoying the fumes and noise of them we had to try and tune out they should be bannedwe arrived at the top had our banana sandwiches and boiled eggs given to us for breakfast by our guide and waited patiently for the sun to rise we were in low season so luckily there were only a few hundred people at the top our guide said that in high season this can easily reach  but there was plenty of room at the top and we didnt feel overcrowded there were some annoying drones at the top as apparently appreciating nature cant be done without the loud buzzing of a machine hovering above after an hour at the top we part jogged part walked back down again making it just over a  hour round trip the views from the top were just stunning and made the trek more than worthwhile for a private guide food and those views id say this trip was inexpensive and a must do if you have the time,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,just dont waste your time and energyit is really hard crowdy and overpricedbut the view is really goodthis is the only one thing that is good butnot by the cost of  hours climbing,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,the top of the volcano is a fantastic place to see the sun rise well worth the hike a organised trip from the hotel with transportation and a very reliable guide well worth the the trip,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,i hired a guide to take me to mount batur from my hotel in kuta we arrived in the late afternoon and i rented a villa at a nearby resort we started the climb at am and stopped at a couple of temples along with the way about halfway up we stopped at a makeshift hut with a couple of picnic tables and took in the view of the lake and adjacent volcano thats where the trail ended and the climb got a little harder another  minute ascent got us to the top and the view was amazing would definitely do again,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,some recommend a guided tour to climb the old volcano it is of course a more comfortable solution than doing it by yourself the tour prices vary from around  usd up to  usd what the tour companies provide is basically the same an early transportation in a minivan and a guided walk uphill some kind of breakfast and then back all this can be done much cheaper by renting a scooter for around  usd per day and driving it to the nearest point of the trail from ubud this takes  hours depending on the traffic at some point you might be stopped by some local people dressed in what looks like uniforms and asked for a pay of around  usd for a permit and insurance this is a scam just drive dont stop and try to argue with them because they have done the scam for years and are very convincing when you reach the village in the bottom of the large crater just follow the road to mount batur at a crossing you should turn left and follow a smaller paved road to a trekking point at this crossing you will be stopped by some local who demands another fee of around  usd per person for a permit and a guide they will most certainly point at a sign which claims that a guide is mandatory this is all fake just drive on if you stop and argue with this people the situation might get nasty and out of hands follow the road until it ends outside a hindu temple where you can park your scooter there is a larger park nearby but that park is crowded with the local guides who will scam you about paying money to the local hustlers some people consider this being aid to starving people to me it is just supporting corruption and paying money to gangsters in a dysfunctional country on the western side of the temple there is a trail uphill follow the trail when reaching a high point you will see a couple of empty buildings take a break and keep on following the trail eventually you will have walked round the crater and will be descending to the temple where you have parked your scooters about climbing the mountain it is not difficult and no mounting climbing experience is of course not needed it can be somewhat exhausting but by taking breaks it can be done by untrained people once on the edge the walk around the crater is easy no special shoes is needed we wore trainers sandals and even flip flops,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,this volcano last erupted in  you can only have a view of it from far for trekking on it you require special permission,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,so this is one of those must do hikes in bali and the views are wonderful on the way up and from the summit of mount baturbut the regular route is super crowded and motor bikes go up and down trying to convince trekkers to grab a lift the motorbike fumes are awful and this really makes for a terrible experienceonce you get to the top make sure you do the true summit which most people miss then traverse around the volcano and visit the two other craters which also provides an alternative descent route which we did without a single other person on the routethe alternate route is not for everyone and can be quite slippery and requires good foot workwe went super fast reaching the summit in  minutes and then had a relaxing traverse before having breakfast and then sauntering down to the start total round trip  hoursnote you are required to take a local guide which i did fortunately i had a young man who was up for a fast pace and was very happy to take the route less travelled,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,there is no doubt the view at the top is spectacular especially for sunrise the route up takes about h m to the very top m and has one or two moderate sections the air gets thin at the top too the route down is a different story at a guess over  of people fell down on the way back  a mixture of loose rock and walking on fine volcanic ash down a very steep hilli enjoyed the trip but you must be fit and nust have some hiking experience,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,we had a mt batur trekkingyou will be amazed by its beauty once you reached the toplovely and had a precious moment with your love onesbefore you go for trek first must have stretchingbring water and extra towel because you will be sweating all the waythere are also monkeys on the top that will be joining your breakfast they are friendly compared with the monkey forest they will just grab your food and water bottles and you will have a chance to take selfies ,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,its intense but so worth itwe were picked up by a driver at am and got to the mountain by am where we met with our guide and started the ascendthe  hour hike is pretty intense lots of cardio so we were stopping a few times during it for water breaks there is an option to walk halfway on an asphalt road but its longer or climb right on the mountain which is more intense but shorter distance we did the first oneonce you get there youll be offered breakfast if you booked with a guide and be aware of the monkeys they steal the food of unawared sleepy tourists so look out and eat quickly haha also hold onto all your belongings those monkeys are quickyou can purchase hot teacoffee on the topyou start the descend whenever you want usually people stay for about hours after the sun is up the way down there is again an option to walk the whole way or take a bike ride halfway down your choicetips bring a good flash light your guide might also give you one bring a jacket it gets hot during the hike but pretty cold up there before the sun fully rises bring proper shoes makes the hike so much easier and enjoyable bring water you will need it sunscreen once the sun is up it burns bring a blanket if you wanna be cozy on the topsit on something soft bring a camera  the view is breathtaking beware of the monkeys they stealenjoy,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,it was an amazing trek but get a guide and if you can get wayan m message me if you want his number not sure if he wants it online he was an excellent very patient guide and will make sure you will get to the summit just before sunrise even if you give up he wont  also recommend getting cardio exercise before going up as its not an easy climb given the loose sand and more so if your group mates are athletic and would just keep going without breaks saw others stopping less than halfway as it was tough you can get a ride going down or up for  idr but the trek is worth itguide gave us hot drinks at the top and modest breakfast bring your own water  it was  idr at the top usual price at minimart is around  idr on the groundskip the hot natural springs  its no longer a spring or the lake but small pools  and not very hot either very basic shower area and locker if youve been to the coffee plantation skip it as well its not the actual plantation but more like a showcase tour products are also relatively cheaper at the airport but if you want the experience do support local enterprises and they give free tasting for  to  products,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,such a blessing for me that i can see the magnificent view from top of mount batur the weather is nice around c and its only  minutes for me to get the top sunrise is rising around am on that time and really good to see it while having a cup of hot chocolate,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,we stayed at bukit catu hostel a cute place to stay and an ideal place to begin to climb the mount you have to climb the mount with a guide you dont need to be very sportive to arrive to the top of it but you need to be healthy it is really a must do and its worth it  the view is amazing and the sunrise is wonderful to admire,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,great hike up to mt batur wonderful views stayed in black lava hostel and took a guide from there  totally recommend that,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,i have only spent a few hours here but i will returnim not much of a mountain climber but this area has so much more to offeri would like to stay at  of the lakeside hotels and check out some of the many restaurants along the highlandsthe geo park should be another great place to visit and understand the area moreif you can visit this area try to spend the whole day here at least,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,had to wake up at am for this but its well worth the effort the view was great the hike up mt batur wasnt too bad as long as you have some basic fitness if not just take more rest stops on your way up can get chilly at the top so wear an extra layer of clothing if you want i personally didnt think it was necessary though,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,wear at least a jacket and good shoes for climbingit was am pick up from our hotel the drive to location included a  minute stop at a roadhouse for breakfast fried banana and coffee or teaarrived at the base greeted by plenty of locals some selling jackets guides etc you dont really need either we were given another breakfast box with an egg bread and banana i fed my egg to the dogs who climb up with everyone in hope of food the only toilets are located at the base so recommend you go before you climb it will cost  rp to useyou have local guides assigned to your tour group stay with them they will give you torches if you didnt bring oneclimb up is about  hours and its mainly a steep rocky narrow path you will feel it in your legs be careful of the loose rocks as you begin to tire there are breaks here and there but they are not long although you can stop whenever you need one of your guides will stay with you at half way point there is an option to take the bike up but it will cost about  rpthere is a stop point just before the summit if you are too tired or wont make it to the top in time it is still a good vantage point to see the sunrise this was the coldest point so a jacket was good they offer drinks here hot chocolate was goodthere was alot of mist this morning so we couldnt see much except when the sun rose over the mountain and cleared the mist for about  mins which was spectacular then the mist came backthen your shown the hot vents and crater where you will also find monkeys watch out for them near the edge they stole my partners water bottle and opened the lid and drank from it properly was quite the sightthe trek down was just as hard as its down the rocks which can be slippery so be careful it turns into a paved road half way down but the steep hill gets to your legswe had an amazing guide called moody who helped encouraged and chatted to people the whole way he also spoke about how he has to do this climb everyday maybe even twice a day to support his family even though it hurts his knees such hard work blesson the drive back we stopped at a coffee plantation where they offered coffee and tea tasting and a chance to try the luwak coffee try here as its way more expensive in the tourist areasoverall great experiance and reasonably priced at  rp from ubud,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,started our journey at am and began trekking at am all worth it for the stunning sunrise views,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,dont let the am wakeup call discourage you from doing thisitll def pay off watching three sunrise from the very top is so worth it,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,never bored to hiking this volcanorock and sandy trekking pathbut its stunning view from the top you can see mt abang mt agung  mt rinjani also batur lake,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,beautiful early morning walk for sunrise delight a challenging few hours but perfectly achievable if taken at the right pace always satisfying at the top we hired a guide but this was not necessary as we took a packed breakfast with us,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,after a few late nights with the crew we were up at am to make the trek up mt batur in balithis was so inspirational our guide was great and spoke good english we werent under pressure by other climbersthe sunrise view was amazing this was worth every cent i paidwe also had breakfast which was included in package,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,we left the hotel  clock we been there  clock me and my wife we was thinking easy to go up there when we start to walking oh my god never ands walking walking break  times never ands so if you like to walking on the mounting get sport shoes comfortable bring water next to you music speakers because u will walk more than  hours late nite its nice walking but its very hard really when we went to top we said yes we made it sunrise its beautiful you got monkeys there you eating breakfast fried banana on white toast and boiled egg after you need to go massages  my opinion the way coming back we take motorbike we couldnt walk  more hours sorry ,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,moved at  am from our hotel in nusa dua and reached to car parking of mount batur tracking point gang of local guides insisted us to hire a guide to climb up we were not willing to hire a guide as they are asking  us dollars after negotiations we were agreed at  us dollars although you can go up without guide just follow other people but local gang forced you to hire a guide be careful your taxi driver is also commission agent of thementrance ticket to kitamani area is  indrtrekking is not easy especially for those who are not use to to do it with good stamina you can reach to the top around  hours,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,we took a tour on klook for a tour in a wd they picked us up around am from ubud hotel and then we started our journey in a normal car we stopped at the bottom of the mountain for a coffee and then we switched to a wd super monster vehicle they took us up mount batur to a view point in time to see the sunrise it was beautiful breathtaking the beauty can not be expressed by wordswe spent about  hour at the view point and then we were taken to the lake batur wonderful little restaurant for breakfast they gave banana pancakes and coffee the view from this point was fabulous you can gaze and wait for hoursthen we switched vehicles and got back to the car and we were taken to coffee plantation and dropped back at the hotel around amon our way back we asked driver to stop at the rice terrace and went on swing as wel this wasnt a part of the tour but we paid driver extra few bucks and did this as wellwe did not want to walk for hours on the usual hike and we opted for this tour it was in total about usd for two people it was well worth it for us,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
1.0,our  friends decided to try and go see the sunrise but when we arrived there on our bikes a group of guides who are nothing more than rude pushers charged us usd per person for a guide that is not even needed we founded a bit pricey for a walk of  hours and decided to inquire more  there are no prices  receipts or rules when you get there  the ticketing office has no information and after we very politely tried to decline their guidance they became aggressive and physical we tried asking if we could pay a ticket but decline the guide and this was met with another tens of people surrounding us and yelling  go away and shut up   to which is possibly the most discouraging that can be said after getting pushed and them trying to take away our motorbike keys  we did not use one curse word or raised our voice once yet the treatment was the same  no police or official to lodge the complaint either so we protested the best way we could and refused the whole thing and not giving this people one cent if you want to do this i highly recommend you dont until they get this stupidity sorted  we are more than willing to pay an entrance price but this shows to the lack of creativity of the locals and the corruption by the police and tourism ministry to allow this to happen right in front of them as they get paid too by the guides to look the other way  avoid at all costs yall  it truly ruined our trip there and most defiantly we wont ever be coming back  bali  wake up  unionize your guides charge a ticket  like any other place  and split the money amongst the local if you so desire  but getting harassed pushed and almost beaten up by  people for trying to go up a trail is not a sustainable business practice strong words that i cant type fyou guides youre rude and dishonest  take your money elsewhere the sun raises regardless,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,mount batur is a beginner friendly hike there are occasional motorbikes offering their service to take you to the top if youre feeling tiredotherwise its a short and easy hike for regular hikersthe view from the top is great i wont say its super amazing like rinjani thomy group paid around k with a local travel company this seems to be the average price there however for local standard this feels a bit expensive,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,you are attracted there by the valley the volcano and the lake plus the balinese people that all together make you feel in the real nature where local life combines with the environment,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,wonderful views good experience kind honest people weather is excellent in november food is always fresh and save to eat on the street fish is excellent and so testy,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,at first we were staying in kuta and mount batur was far from there like  kms and on top of that you got to leave the hotel at  am in the morning to reach there by  am the trekking starts as soon as you reach there we hired a personal guide the complete cost with transit was  indonasian rupiah the trekk is quite hard and steep with sand and gravel which mskes it more tough to grip the grounds make sure you choose a right pair of shoe to avoind slipping the treck starts easy and gets tough as you move ahead there are  ways in between one is easy one and other one is hard one the hard one is very hard as we took that route in return and the easy one was also a bit hard and steep the trekking goes through the forest and lava rocks but when you are  minutes away from the top you start getting mesmerizing views which was the biggest motivation for me there are motor bikes available in the easy route if you give up at any point but believe me do not take those bikes because you wont get the feeling of hardwork when you get on top the views at the top are mesmerizingthe clouds are below you and you get that blissful vibe when you reach up there a bit tiring but a must do thing in bali prefer doing it when you stay in ubud,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,there were four in my party all of us over  yo  we had two guides with usour climb started at the foot of mt batur at about am it was pitch black each step we took was by torch light and the path wad literally a goat track nevertheless we plodded on and reached the summit just before dawnfor our breakfast our guides buried uncooked eggs in the groundmins later the were cooked from heat of the volcano there was some cloud just below the summit but the view was still magnificent  we circumnavigated the crater even thou mt batur is still an active volcano its been some time since it last erupted and the crater is overgrown with plant life we made our way down a different track goiing down was more difficult than going up due to loose rocks on the track it was hard not to slip the trek lasted about  hours after which we went to nearby natural hot spring pools to soothe our aching muscles it was heaven on earth sitting in the pools with mt batur in the background,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,first off if you are at all into any physical activity on holiday please do this secondly if not for our fantastic guide ari i might maybe have diedjk but this is really not an easy trek and lastly this is absolutely incredible a great feeling of accomplishment and a few that cannot be duplicated on any camera even better when shared with a loved one,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,well second day of our trip in bali and met beautiful group of  people and a nice guidestarted from base camp at midnightits highly risky if you are not used to trekking as there are so many pebbles loose rocks and ashes so could get scratches too but whats the fun without all these natural thingsloved the trekking and most importantly when we reach on the top the sun rise which is the most special thingwished to trek more towards upwards but got to know its from other side so will trek another time but the experience was thrillingand guide helped us a lottake water with you and snacks and some glucose or electrol ors powder or juice to fuel you up,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,great climbover crowded thoughtook us around  hours to get to the topbreathtaking viewsmake sure you wear proper hiking bootsnot coldtake snacks as they dont offer any meals,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,too crowded and risky trekking you cant back out in between path is extremely narrow and completely filled with ash and pebbles which makes it very difficult to climb good part is our guides were there with us for the whole trip and supported whenever required yes it is a rewarding expetience once you are at the top view from the top is mesmerizingoverall a mixed experience anybody with slightest doubt must avoid,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,the hike itself is pretty challenging as the path is very sandy and your grip on the ground always looses the altitude itself isnt a problem but be prepared that its quite a continuous slope all the way up and that is being the easy path already  there is a harder path up the mountain the view at summit of mountain is very spectacular and is definitely worth the hard workrental for thicker coats available at base camp saw an unfriendly local speaking to a group of visitors from get your guide something like they should support locals instead of cant catch the word and that they dont deserve to sit at the top of the mountain blah blah blah maybe its something about the local mafiaone major turn off is that they offer scooter transport up to the neartop of mountain the motorbikes makes the path very dusty and irritates my breathing i kept coughing whenever they pass by despite already covering my nose and mouth with my sleeves i would not recommend this hike for anyone with respiratory problems,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,it was a challenging climb and i may have been a bit hungover from my birthday  probably not the best combination the couple we climbed with and our guide were very tolerant of my slow and not so gracious climb to the top it is fairly steep with not many places to rest reaching the top to watch sunrise through the clouds however was worth the pain i was going through there was a lot of people at the top and it was freezing cold definitely a place to visit,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,i was exhausted when i hiked up to the mount i was gonna give up but i didnt and it pay up the view was perfect,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,so i like to think of myself as relatively fit as i am a weekly power walker have climbed wayna picchu in peru etc but this volcano got me i have a hard time hiking uphill and no one told me that this hike was straight uphill with no break about  of the way up while i was gasping for air i finally left our guide and my friend and sadly opted for the easy way out of having a motor bike drive me to almost the top and dropped me off there to wait to meet up again with our guide and my friend we then all hiked up the last  minutes from the motor bike drop off point to the summit in time to see the sunrise such a beautiful site watching the sun come up we both loved it we remained up at the top for about an hour to an hour and a half soaking in the views and taking photos then started the descent back down which was no problem whatsoever for me in fact i ran a great part of the trail down so just a word of warning if a non stop uphill hike is something that is difficult for you or you suffer from asthma i would consider taking the motorbike up once you are out of energy as the sunrise is so very beautiful at the top i also saw some others that needed to catch a motorbike up to the top as well but most made it up there with no issues granted i am in my s and was probably the oldest one there attempting this everyone else looked to be in their s and s max and remember to negotiate for the motorbike ride up there i payed a ridiculous amount of  not negotiating stupid me but at that point i just did whatever it took to get to the top haha have fun and enjoy,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,beautiful views of the mountain really enjoyed the lunch at the restaurant over looking the mountain it was a delicious buffet meal,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,fantastic hike not too hard beautiful views and great to relax in the hot pools after our driver widi was fantastic very friendly and knowledgeable,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,my husband and i went on honeymoon to bali and being keen sunrise enthusiasts booked the above tour online with get your guide ahead of our travels paying  each was our first mistake as we came to learn that this was a heavily inflated package spruced up to sound a lot more luxurious than it turned out to bewe were collected on time from our accommodation outside ubud approx am joing  other guests in an unmarked car by a young man in very casual wear though i came to learn this is normal for easy going bali in hindsight i feel that a uniform and branded vehicle would have been more professional given we booked through a professional agent and for a professional and hefty price over an hour later we arrived to a small village afoot mt batur along with several other vehicles  many of which were branded get your guide odd we seemed to hover here indefinitely where we were each given a small bottle of water and headlamp though the straps were broken so these had to be hand held appreciated none the less as it was pitch black different clusters of guests were allocated to different guides some in uniform some not but mostly all in casual wear some guests got given walking sticks we werent offered the luxury of such but hey ho the toilet was horrendous a mere hole in the ground with no running water nor latch on the door being african im used to this scene  just not when ive forked out  for half a days excursionwe set off around am and were told we would be at the top within an hour baffled given the scale of the mountain i trusted our trained and experienced supposedly english speaking guide and marched along you could see there were already masses ascending the mountain from every angle and more at the top we trudged through local farmland scattered with litter and debris nice before the incline up loose volcanic rock and terrain began thank heavens i had packed my own l of water as our mini ml didnt touch sidesthe climb is tough going and gets steeper as you go along the guide respected the slowest of the groups pace moving aside to let the stream of trekking folk pass when need be a couple of people gave up at halfway an hour in so were left on the side of the mountain while we continued i did the math and this was clearly going to take longer than an hour  a shame as the skyline was already a hint of pinkjust when you wonder whether any health and safety precautions have been taken the summit is within reach  and its a race against the clock with the guide confirming  minute till sunrise we make it to the top just in time only for the novelty to be dampened by hundreds of other folk trawling the crater hawkers trying to sell you an overpriced worm coke and drones whizzing all over the placewe find a spot to enjoy the view and are thankful for the moderately clear skies the guides turn their hands to photography and get some great shots of their guests the view is honestly spectacular and well worth the calf killing climbbreakfast is served  a cold and tasteless egg sandwich some fruit and a questionable cup of coffee i appreciate we are at the top of a mountain and whilst im not expecting a hotel buffet im disappointed and try find the value in a steam cooked eggonce the novelty of sunrise has worn off trekkers queue for prized shots at the highest point amidst the steam and for the perfect instagram pic i just dont see the appeal really hustling atop a volcano and all thatwe commence our journey down which some find worse than the climb up the guides keep everyone in good spirits with their banter though as volcanic ash collects in your shoes and the sun beats down on your already sweaty efforts again  thankful for my own stash of water as the sign of anymore from our guide is long gonewe reach the bottom and are trundled into the same car and prepared for an hour and half journey to the hot springs we arrive  minutes later puzzled and are surprised that the hot springs are a series of swimming pools with pvc pipes at the ready spewing what i imagine contributes the only natural element to the experience we meet once again the hundreds of hikers from atop the mountain and take in the slightly hotel pool scenario with disappointmentwe are provided with a towel and a grotty looking change room with lockers before being ushered to a somewhat open looking massage quarters we are treated to great balinese massages which i actually cant fault until my masseuse demands a good tip  and in gbp i might add i cant help but leave with a sour taste in my mouththe pools are overrated and overcrowded with replicas of the same complexes all along the lake shore we take more interest in the nearby fish farms at  sharp  we are hurried by the driver to the nearby coffee plantation as we didnt know this was on the agenda we visited a plantation further north the day before and came away with some coffee tea and chocolate for the benefit of the other  guests still with us we join the coffee tour led by someone who clearly didnt want to be there and whose english didnt extend beyond his somewhat aggressively delivered script of the lewark and bali coffee processes none of us enjoyed the tourso in summary although the sunrise trek is largely rave worthy i wouldnt bother with the massage hot springs or coffee plantation add ons do the latter elsewhere in your own time as it has the potential to be interesting and seriously research the price of a guide if not bookhaggle one once in bali the best value ive seen online is  pp and includes transfer the hike and if you could call it breakfast i certainly wouldnt pay  again,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
2.0,we went today to mt batung sunrise along with perhaps other ca  tourists the sun rise is beautiful which is why i am giving  stars and not  the impression is totally destroyed by way too many people going one by one on the narrow path in dust dust mask would have helped even worse when going down as there is no chance to pass the crowd so for the  minutes of beautiful scenery several hours of horror maybe great for people who dont mind crowds loud music on the way and cheerful screaming of the crowd when the sun rises not for me tough who enjoys more authentic experiences,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,the hiking trip itself wasnt hard at all anyone can do the trip we had to walk in line too crowded for my taste we had to go so slow that we couldnt loose a sweat if we wanted toits possible to run up the mountain in  minutes no problem starting height is about m above sea levelwe were told that we couldnt hike without a guide but i cant see the problem the path was in good condition my guess is that they says all that bullsh because of the money incomethe sunrise though was magical it was worth the trip but will not do it again,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,its a still active volcano in kintamaniwe saw it from the village bridge and not that much visible,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,hard trek for the sunrise but well worth it at the end highly recommend doing this to all bali visitors,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
1.0,do not support the mountain mafiawe decided as a group to take a taxi to the volcano and do the easy trekking by ourselves as previous comments reveal  not possible due to the mountain mafiawe got harrased verbally and physially abused by the ignorant inbreed mountain mafia portraying to work for the government pushing around women half their size and yelling at their faces discustingthey had even a selfprinted government padge that they showed for  second before hiding it i asked to have a closer look to check the details and ofcourse i could not do that without aggressive shouting about me disrespecting their country wow was able to see that it was definately something made in the next door garageyou can go to the mountain by purchasing a over priced tour i would not recommend anyone supporting this mafia activity you should not have to pay for a sunriseps pictures are taken from the village next to mt batur as beautiful sunrise no mafia,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,we started our hight with a tour guide leaving our hotel at  am and starting the hike at around  am we reached the top around  am and had the most amazing view of the sunrise myself and my partner are quite fit and didnt have any problems hiking however there were many people throwing up on the side of the mountain due to the crowds of people walking up the mountain we werent going at a fast pace i would recommend taking a jacket and wearing trainers as its quite cold at the top would do it again,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,the night hike up mount batur to watch the sunrise from the top has been my favorite adventure on this trip thus far we hired a driver and specialist to be sure we did not have to worry about getting ripped off by one of the guides and he gave us an amazing adventure his name is mully ketut let me know if youd like to connect with him directly highlights challenging hike so got a great sweat and good workout colors in the sunrise i had never seen before very clear so could see neighboring mount agung and lake below coffee at the top served hot monkeys at the top caldera steaming easy trek downthe only reason i give this  instead of  rating lots of tourists the huts built at the top infringe on the natural beauty of the mountain the guides waiting are not awful but the experience would be more enjoyable without hagglerstips if you have your own headlamp and trekking sticks take them take some small snacks wear good walkinghiking shoes that you dont mind getting dirty ashdust on the trail,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,climb to the top was not the easiest but with the right sports shoes and mindset its well worth the exercise and challengegetting to the summit with unobstructed views of the sunrise while having warm hot chocolate in the chilly temperatures was one of the finest feelings ive ever experiencedthis world and particularly indonesia is indeed beautiful,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,sunday th september and we visited kintamani where both mount batur and lake batur are situatedwe were here as one of the stops on our great bali introduction tour which we booked through the tui rep in our hotel it was a cultural tour including places of interestwe got our first view of mount batur which is an active volcano and lake batur as we approached kintamani the volcano last erupted in we got a grandstand view of the from the rooftop viewing point at kintamani hotelthere are tours and expedition to climb mount batur this was not an option on our tour we were happy with our rooftop viewsadly it was a bit overcast on the day we visited and visibility could have been better having said that it was still rather spectacular and the cloud surrounding the volcano gave it an eerie feel,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,we are average hikers and the hike was definetely not worth paying fir a guidethe trip was beatiful and at times a bit challenging but as long as you pay attention there is no danger at alllights are though neededthe trip around the crater top is a must,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,amazing sunset worth the hike choose the difficult path if you want a good hike do not book with bali sunrise treaking as you can get much better deal else where as they are over priced the views are fantastic and you definitely worth the trek ,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,i didnt climb the mountain but i spent all morning looking at it from different places and it is breathtaking,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,a km long hike but with km height difference takes you up to the caldera of one of the high mountains on bali around halfway up you get the choice for an easy or a hard trail the easy trail was challenging at times for us as untrained hikers but doable on the easy trail you can always opt for a taxi via motorcross bike note the hard trail is to steep for them no taxi therethe last  minutes is a steeper part on to the summitto share a bit of sense on the duration we started the hike at  arrived at the summit around  stayed there for  an hour and where back down at around  thanks fitbitduring the hike youll encounter a temple and several shrineson the top you have a magnificent view of the island with the  larger mountains acting as a beautiful backdrop to the scenenote during your hike you can meet people that offer you drinks always ask the price first and make up your mind on how much you want to give they will offer to follow you all the way up the mountain if youre not making clear you are not going to buy anythingtips bring water good walking shoes are a must definetly no open shoes a lot of sand and sharp stones when descending a sole with a good grip is advised bring swimwear and finish this hike with a visit to the nearby natural hotsprings for your aching muscles and a shower to wash away the black lava sand  bring a sweater andor windproof vest when we visited there was a chilling wind on the summit bring long pants also if youre a chilly type,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,this morning my husband and me took on the trek to watch the glorious sunrise from the top of mount batur we booked through get my guide and our guide ari was amazing it is a challenging hike and neither of us are what you would call regular hiking fans at home  but ari was patient great company and encouraging throughout so so glad we went it was definitely worth the mega early start,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,thats the higher mountain in bali island and we lucky to get open sky day that atraction is a sightsee and can be combine with many others tours since he is the biggest montain and can be seen from diferent areas when the skyes are blue very nostalgic scenary with many fruit sellers on the way,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,we woke up at am to get on a bus from our villa and started climbing at am but it was one of the most amazing things ive ever donewe had a local guide not a tour who took us up a back way more of a direct climb but much steeper rockier and challenging it was a tough climb doing it that way but absolutely epic because we got to see the most authentic parts of batur sitting at the top as the sun rose was breathtaking we got a cloudy morning and couldnt see much at the top but on the way down we got some incredible viewsdefinitely  recommend doing a hike here you wont regret it,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,you should get at the baturs area at  at the morning to get a chance to see sunset from the top of the batur volcano if you are not ready to cardio you can rent the bike to get at the top almostview from the top is awesome,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,despite it was a bit overcrowded during the trek like people had to queue for climbing up you would find it worth after you have reached the top and enjoyed watching the sunrise make sure you wear a proper shoes as it was a bit slippery while climbing out there,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,my dad me and a friend booked a private guide who brought us to the top in the beginning you have a normal road in my opinion but our friend was unfit and found it really hard then there was a meeting point after min where you have to chose between the easy road and the difficult road you can also go by motorbike to a place near the top what our friend did because she was not gonna make it to the top my dad and i chose the difficult road because we like challenges but this was way to difficult haha i had to take a break every  minutes because it was really steep and you just had to take big steps the whole time but the guide said that the easy road is way to crowded and that a lot of motorbikes pass by what makes you not enjoy nature to the fullest after maybe h we met our friend back and continued a min walk to the top and enjoyes the sunrise it was beautifull but also really cold so you will definitely thank yourself later if you bring a blanket on the way back we did the easy road and it looked way more easy then the road that we did to the top we also waited untill most of the people went down so we could relax and not be bothered by big groups passing by the whole timei liked the hike and would recommend but i think when u go in summervacation it is way to crowded and difficult to enjoy,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,was a solo traveller and was assigned  guide  ratio from my accommodation triangle house at the base of mount batur the view at the summit was breathtaking and amazing the beautiful view of the sunrise is dependent on the weather during my hike the sky was clear blue and we are above the sea of cloud my guide told me that some days it can be very foggy that they could not see the sunrise the hike can be tiring but manageable as long as you take rest stops along the wayduring my hike my guide told me that it was colder than usual my  windbreaker was not enough at the summit and it was freezing there are locals renting blanket so you can rent one if you are really freezing otherwise the hike in the cold was okay as you are generating body heati opt for the long hike to visit  carters and a cave and there is this one part of the hike that can be dangerous  loose black sand and the steep slope you will need to be careful and be on your butt during the climb down so you dont fall my guide was really helpful by holding my handif you think that you have overcome the physical challenge during the hike up  you are wrong you will need to be careful during the hike down as there are loose sands and you can slip and fall those with knee problem will have to be extra careful during this hike down for an average person the hike down was not tiring but need to be carefulall in all it was a great experience and i highly recommend to anyone who want to take up the challenge and see the beautiful sunrise at the summit,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,there are multiple tour stands around ubud we payed a decent amount and from the time we were picked up to the time we were dropped off there was little to no direction we were in an over crowded van and our group was pretty cranky maybe because it was so early in the morning the guides we got did not speak english or indonesian i have a basic knowledge of indonesian and i still couldnt communicate with themthe hike was very difficult for me but rest assured when you get halfway up the mountain there are dirt bikes you can hire to take you the rest of the way total worth the cost there were too many people on the mountain but we found a place where we felt secludedeven though getting there communicating and the hike itself were a little rough its truly a once in a lifetime experience we have never seen that many star or a more magical sunrise when you get back to the asphalt at the bottom you can rent bicycles for cheap and clock  mph making your way back to the parking lotseriously a highlight of our trip,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,do not be put off by some of the reviewsmy partner and i did the sunrise trek to the top with a prebooked guide from our villa we are in our early twenties with a pretty good level of fitness we didnt find it a hard trek fitnesswise but a more technical trek where you have to focus on where you are placing your feet the first part of the trek is a steady and gradual ascent first up asphalt and then a rocky ground the last part of the trek is the hardest as the ground is a sandy ash and has little gripthere are a lot of people i wouldnt say its overcrowded like many reviews state but we may have gone on a good day some parts you have to line up waiting for other tourists but there are lots of stop areas along the way which is where we passed some of the other groupsit took us  hr  min to ascend and arrive at the top and  hr to descend going down is easier but slippery on the first part due to the loose groundtips prebook your guide it will save you money and the hassle of finding a good one amongst the locals wear good walking shoes cannot stress this enough we saw many people wearing converse and they were slipping everywhere also your shoes will get very dusty bring a warm jacket for the top as it gets cold and windy,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
1.0,too many people and at times very dangerous very difficult climb in the dark people slipping and youre climbing one after the next in a crazy long crowd,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,we woke up at  in the morning and arrived there at about   it is about  hours to get on the top there are many people and it gets overcrowded  it is not the easiest trek mainly due to the fact that are many people going up at this particular time for the sunrise and it gets a bit challenging a little before you get on the top  the view is rewarding though if it is not foggy at the time of the sunrise  in our case it was foggy but it cleared out about  min later  so we had the chance to see a great view  worth visiting  a nice experience  oh and get a jacket with you  on the top it gets a bit cold ,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
2.0,very crowded and a challenging trekwe started off meeting our tour guide she was lovely and helped us all the way throughwhen you get to the top the views are amazing there are hundreds of people trying to get to the top its chaos  pitch black at the beginning with only a torch to guide youthe last  of the way was very challenging it was very steep we wore acceptable footwear toowhen we got to the top we were taken aback with peoples rudeness of just standing in front of us there is a lot of space at the top to sit down and enjoy the view there really is no need to stand in other peoples waythe way down was also toughthere is no preparation at the beginning either no safety talk etc just meet your guide and off you goim glad that we done this trek but i wouldnt do it again  not sure i would recommend to anyone either,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
2.0,we booked the trip as a group of  who all have a high fitness level we managed it but there was no advice on the physical demands that are expected and the route down was quite challengingwe also thought it would be a handful of groups going up the mountain at am instead we was faced with thousands of others and was in a queue from the bottom all the way up the top with a one person track breakfast was also a bit of a let down two sliced of plain bread and a boiled egg given at the start to carry up with youthe views were amazing but it wasnt worth the crowds,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,pros if you make it for the sunrise it is truly spectacular the views are amazing if you are lucky enough to get a cloudless daycons this is not a trek the first half of the walk is up a road that cars can drive up the second half is actually up the mountain it is not a strenuous trek but what makes it difficult is all the people there are some trying to overtake and others needing to go slower its chaos,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,there are literally hundred of people climbing the mountain its ridiculous that you need a guide to go up there its very very easy mass tourism and mafia definitely a one time experience for me,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,quite daring at first level but once you reach on the top all tiredness change to happiness  its that ahaa moment,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,hot springs in crater worth visiting entry to area  when you come from rice terraces mountain can be climbed with guide or in trip for sunrise views,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,waking up in the morning  hours drive from sanur and then hrs hike up to the top of the active volcano to watch sunrise was all worth it it is a advance hike as surface is partly sand stones and ashes however tour guides are amazing and many people even bit older made it to the top our guide pande was absolutely great funny carrying and chatty i recommend it to anyone either single or couples,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,paid idr k per person took us hour up then  hour to hang around the breakfast place another hour down the view is nice enough but idr k is quite expensive and since the peak was so congested we couldnt hang around as long as i would have liked,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,if you are nature lover and love to see natural beauty from the peak of the mountain surrounded by clouds has unbelievable view but for that you have to trek so hard if you are weak at there than it cant be in your list,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,bucket list experience decided that day i would fly to bali booked flight organized driver and tour guide am at base of mountain climbing,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,me and  other women from my yoga and meditation programme in lovina got picked up at am and our driver took us to the base to meet our guides our two guides were amazing very calm attentive and both held my hand up and down the mountain it was a pretty hard climb particularly if your very tired like i was when you get to the top its so worth it view is beautiful luckily we had a clear day too so afterputting my jacket and thin jumper back on it wasnt too cold our guides each gave us a torch and recommended to use a walking stick which definitely helped take plenty of water snacks and if you know its gonna take you a little longer try take off earlier and have short stops on the way to catch your breath we saw monkeys at the top and stray dogs we also had a spiritual blessing in a cave and gave an offering,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,my friend was visiting me from australia and since we were staying in ubud and had both heard the trek was great we decided to go last minutei had my motorbike so we figured we would just head up there for am i had heard that you have to hire a local guide at the bottom so i was expecting to pay around  or something for them wow was i wrong as soon as i pulled into the car park i was surrounded by a bunch of guys and i told them i needed a guide and their starting price was we tried to see if we could join another group and just give them some money towards their tour but the guides harassed us we tried to just walked up but were physically stopped and told that we were bad tourists and had no respect for the sacred mountain by this time we had already woken up at am and driven all that way and if we didnt head up then it would have been for nothing and we wanted to experience it so we caved and paid  eachbecause we had lost time we rode up on the bike as far as we could so we could catch the sunrise its true that there is a huge line of people and its slow moving im not very fit so that was fine for me but our tour guide recommended we take the harder but more rewarding pathwe decided to do it and push ourselves and it was really really a hard climb for me but at the top i was appreciative that we were away from the crowds in our own area our guide was really good after the initial nastiness about paying and was very kind and helpful in supporting me up the hillthe view was lovely and it was a rewarding experience so im glad i did it because it was stunning and i was proud to have made it up the steep path and our guide was one of the better ones from the other reviewsits definitely a tourist trap though and i was surprised at the huge amount of people and i really didnt enjoy being bullied at the beginningi wish the guides would set a reasonable price list and adopt a friendlier attitude its the first time ive ever dealt with this kind of aggression from locals so if you love to climb i think its a fun climb but you could also easily enjoy the sunrise from a cafe on the edge of the crater and save yourself some money,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,anyone out there keen to summit mt batur with me without a guide wanting to go but not into the usual tourist group thing im in ubud at present,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
2.0,yes it is a spectacular view if you can get to see it with all the aggressive sellershawkers up there it cost to get there then it cost to go up the volcano and it just keeps on costing if you are on a budget be careful the drive around the volcano and lake was well worth it oh yeah and they charge to use the toilet and make sure you bring your own paper the drive up the range to get to mount batur you will find plenty of monkey roaming freely and their are places where you can park,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0, introductionmt batur is an active volcano located near lake batur about a two hour drive north of kuta it is a very popular climb due to the magnificent sunrise views from its three summits congratulations point western summit main summit  ft trailheadthere are two main starting points batur guide station in the village of toya bungkah near the bukit mentik temple this is the more popular of the two trails to the top because it is a shorter and gentler climb i used this trail and this review is about this trail pura jeti  this is the trail to choose if you like a steep trail jagged rocks and also fewer other climbers on the trail information sourcesunfortunately i was unable to find reliable information about this climb before my hike so i decided to write this review in the hopes that it would help others enjoy this experience level of difficultythe level of difficulty primarily depends on your fitness this hike is doable for anyone in reasonably good condition if they walk at a pace that is appropriate for them even though it is steep in sections and the scree can be challenging to an experienced hiker in good condition this will seem like a fairly moderate climb but to someone who is not in that good of hiking shape this can be a challenging and difficult climb best time of yearmt batur can be hiked year round but the best weather is usually april  october the busiest months are july and august guidesalthough guides are not required and not really needed since the trail is easy to follow it is probably best that you hire one many people have written about the harassment bullying and threats that climbers who do not wish to use a guide are subjected to at the trailhead you can either hire a guide ahead of time or hire one at the trailhead in toya bungkah there is an association of guides and the rate is fixed trail distancestoya bungkah trail  miles round trippura jeti trail   miles round trip elevationstoya bungkah trailhead  ftflat section of trail  ftcongratulations point  ftsummit  ft vertical elevationsthe vertical elevation you will climb to the summit is  ft there are no ups and downs on this trail before reaching the crater rim at congratulations point if you wish to hike to the highest summit of mt batur it is a  minute hike from congratulations point you will descend about  vt ft and then ascend about  vt ft more to reach the highest summit itinerarymost people try to summit for sunrise leaving their hotels from kuta at about  am to start the trek at about  am the advantages of doing this are hopefully seeing a beautiful sunrise from the summit cooler temperatures to climb in less traffic from kuta etc to the trailheadthe major disadvantage is that you will not be alone there are often  people on the trail and the summit with you i opted to leave the hotel at  am and started at  am there was traffic from kuta and the sun was out and it was hot climbing but we saw no one else on the trail and only a father with his daughter praying at the summit temple choose the experience you wish trail descriptionthe trail is mostly volcanic rock and scree it is steep in numerous places and ascending in the scree can be challenging as you tend to slide back each step splaying your feet a bit walking like a duck can give you more traction the key is to choose well where you step and just slowly keep moving forward the first  minutes of the trail is fairly flat or moderately uphill this is mostly an agricultural area but after this the trail is fairly steep all the way to congratulations point with one exception about halfway up there is a flat section for about  meters many people who feel that they cannot or do not want to climb higher stop here fortunately this is also a good place to view the sunrise water along trailthere is no water along the trail if you do the sunrise hike there will be people on the summit selling water soda beer food etc so you will only need to carry what you need for the way up the prices reflect the fact that these items must be carried up if you hike during the day like i did then you must carry sufficient water etc for both the ascent and descent i carried  liter which was sufficient what to bringif you do the sunrise hike it can be chilly at the top especially if you arrive early and have to wait for the sunrise bring along a warm layer if you hike later in the day like i did the sun can be brutal i would recommend a lightweight longsleeve shirt sunglasses baseball hatsun hat and sunscreen time estimatesthis is always a hard thing to say since it depends on many factors including your fitness level weather pack weight how often you stop to take breaks pictures etc that being said most people take     hrs to reach the summit a very fit and experienced hiker can summit in less than an hourthe descent will take about    of the time it took you to ascend it is great fun the scree that was so challenging on the ascent is now your friend each step you take you also slide another couple of feet down in the scree accelerating your descent one disadvantage your shoes will be filthy outside and inside from the volcanic scree dust etc as will your legs from the knee down altitudemt batur is certainly high enough that you will notice the difference in your breathing but other than this very few people have any issues with the altitude miscif you are coming from kuta or denpasar there are a lot of interesting things to do on your drive back including hot springs waterfalls craft stores in ubud rice terraces in ubudi would recommend talking with your transport provider beforehand and choosing to enjoy a few of these things after the hike on the way back to kuta conclusionhiking mt batur was one of the highlights of my time in bali i hope that you enjoy it as much as i did if you have any questions please feel free to contact me,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
1.0,i climbed mount batur today from  am with my boyfriend and a guide the guide costed k rupies each after negotiation it was recommemded by our driver i would not recommend to climb the volcano because you are obliged to climb with a guide that you have to pay a lot and provide you with no service our guide did not explain anything and was not interested at all in our safety i often go trekking and i was wearing trekking shoes for me the descent was very very slippery you need to take your time go very slowly and wear trekking shoesi would recommend to climb mount batur only with a professionale guide that deserves the pay or to go alone if you are good trekkerslandscape from mount batur is beautiful but the environment is full of litter,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
1.0,nothing to say about the view that is very nicewe did the day climbing arriving there at am once arrived they charged us k rupies after negotiation only k saved more than  eur per person and giving us a very young guide that didnt know english and could not explain anything about the trip but just indicating the road that was already very clear the mountain itself was not too bad but full of litters and garbages all around that in my opinion ruined the experience in italy such shameful ruined environment was not possible to find anywherethe question is  what you are offering with  euro  nothing and its a shame the guide was literally running and during the descent was hard to follow her such that my girlfilrfend falled down and hurt herself  the track si very slipperyplease avoid wasting money and fueling this shameful experience its a theft robbery organized by local and no respectful peoplehoping that some people will use brain and not giving  stars just for a good foto on instagram because this is not tourism its just being stupid and cheated the max i can do is giving  stars with the hope that someone will read this and understandplease stay away,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,we took a day trip up to mount batur to catch the sunrise unfortunately it was too foggy and a freezing  deg c something i never expected nevertheless it wasnt a trip wasted we explored penulisan temple  saw some carvings from  bc there tooif you want something different from the beautiful beaches this is a wonderful alternative,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,batur is miracle of nature we decided to go there for the sunset and go back after it is dark this was great decision as we were only three people up there batur was mysterious misty and seemed dangerous it also offered great views steam coming out from ground and deep craterthe most popular way to visit batur is  am trekking to see sunrise i suppose it may be bad experience as we saw what is left on the top large piece of this amazing place is spoiled by tourists and turned into large latrine  no one really maintain any facilities on top and thousands of people go there to see sunriseadviceyou must have a guide you must have good boots  trekking is on sharp volcanic rock ascend is steep and not for children fortunately ours decided to stay at hot springs descent after its dark may be dangerous if not led by guide,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,its was amazing like to be on the top of the mountain like that and see the volcano and having the best view ever and to see the origin village for the balinese and the big lake was wow like something you need to do must to see that and have the best picture ever,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
2.0,at first we thought it should be a nice trekking tour to the vulkane batur but it wasntwhen you decide to make the tour you need a dust mask it was so dusty more than  peoples goes the small path up to the mountain so you stand walk stand walk and also motor cross bikes are driven on the small pathwhen you catch the top you must have luck to see the sunrise i recommend to check the weather forecast before you start and bring with you good shoes warm clothes and a flashlight,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,walking batur for sunrise was the highlight of our holiday the walk was enjoyable despite the scrambler bikes everywhere and the views were incredible its cold up there so take a jacket even if youre welsh but really recommend this,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
1.0,had the complete sunrise trekking tour in midaugust  with my familythis is hell on earth or something that closely resembles itno need to describe what the tour is about because this is widely dealt with in any travel guide and there are countless feeds on tripadvisor and countless social media about the experiencei think this is something to avoid at all costs for the following reasons there are thousands of people ascending the mountain every night you literally walk in a row from the beginning to the top no privacy no sensation of doing something in the wilderness it feels like being on the london underground on a busy weekday at am you are just packed like a sardine in an endless column you do not see the surroundings when you go up because it is night and dark but when you descend in the daylight you are stunned by the sorry state of mount batur debris dispersed everywhere plastic and the inevitable traces of the passage of thousands of careless tourists every day my environmental spirit was disgusted at the scenery surrounding me it looked like a calcutta slum all the way up every  seconds or so for a solid hour and a half of ascent and then on the subsequent way down you are forced to step aside the trail to let pass the socalled mototaxis which are old and gas guzzling trial motorcycles or the cheap indonesian version of it ferrying lazy passengers to the top the noise the pollution the risk of being run over by these criminals is so high that it makes the entire trail look like a modern version of dantes infernolas but not least there is no chance that the sun will eventually break into the heavy clouds and the thick cold and humid fog that surrounds the mountain topthe day we did it aug th  there was nothing but a thick fog which prevented us from seeing anywhere beyond  metres ahead of us until we were back down at the starting point exhausted and frustratedin a word you wake up at am you travel long distances to reach the strarting point and then you leave for a few hours of sorrow for which you have to pay an exhorbitant price just to be literally gassed by a gang of criminals and you can barely speak to your companions as you are enlisted in a mile long row of slaves ascending the mountaincrazy,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
1.0,we were really looking forward to this hike as we love spending time in nature and we frequently do sunrise hikes back home too so we thought okay why not in bali might be a bit crowded but we are only here once so lets do thiswell we should have thought twice and read the bad reviews closely and taken them more seriously this was the most horrible experience ever there were literally thousands not hundreds of people you hsd to queue to take your next step guides were literlly carrying unfit visitors up the mountain there were human excrements everywhere to a point where it was just stinking on the way back down in the sun we can handle a lot but this exploitation of nature is just unbearable dont go if you wanna keep your sanity walking up and down and if you dont wanna start hating every single tourist on bali,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,the whole experience of mount batur was brilliant we received a surprise banana pancake at base camp and then had a follow up breakfast up the top of the mountain which we did know aboutthe climb itself is quite tough we do a lot of walking and scaled ben nevis a few years ago but this was quite a challenge but totally worth it it is very steep in places particularly after the first top but with a good pair of walking boots and the will power you will definitely get up to the top as once you do it is so worth it for the beautiful sunrisecoming down you take a different more gradual path but this can still be hard going on the legsthe biggest surprise for us was how busy it was so be prepared to queue when scaling the mountain and top tip take tissues maybe a sheewee for the ladies as the toilets coming down are quite grim and you will have to pay anything up to  idr for themwe would definitely recommend this experience however do prepare it isnt just a simple walk you will need tissueswet wipeshand sanitizer or sheewee good boots warm clothes it is freezing up the top a hot spring or spa session afterwards to reward your muscles look out for friendly monkeys at the top,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,mount batur is an active volcano in kintamani district bangli regency bali indonesia wikipediaplease take care of your cleanliness when climbing do not litter do not speak harshly think dirty and behave badly for women do not climb during menstruation,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,we had booked our trip online with bali volcano trekking and felt this was a great trip it had started raining heavily where we were staying and the driver was nearly an hour late in picking us up the tour operator offered a refund or rescheduling if we wanted due to the weather but we decided to keep going the driver made up for lost time and we got to sleep the trip just a long ride from seminyak and an easy to moderate hike up to mount batur it was a bit disappointing to see so many people who were taking motorcycles up to the top if you cant hike im wondering why they signed up for the trek it seemed like a very good business for the driversgetting to the top there were seats and places for a warm drink we were offered a simple breakfast and a nice warm drinkthe views were stunning as the sun peaked through some of the clouds it was incredible to see the amount of people that were on the mountain it was a highlight and im glad were able to do the hike to the top,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,i didnt go sunrise trekking thats why its just average for me i stayed in accomodation just across toya devasya cheaper option for accomodation with hot spring its only k per night walk  minutes across the accomodation youll see batur lake they also have a tent option on the lake side,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,the view of mount batur rising from the batur lake makes you feels as you are in a postcard world one can trek to see the lower crater not to the highest point it will be cold up there so better get some warm clothesthe sunrise was just awesome,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
1.0,this excursion is offered by many tour operators and hundreds take it every daythe mountain is lovely and the views are breathtaking but the excursion quality is very iffy and the way the unregulated mt batur guidestour operators behave like a mafia can make this a horrible experience i dont think it is worth it and it left a horrible taste in the mouth ruined our last day and half in baliwe used ubud sunrise trekking to do this and were ina group of total  people morning of th aug we did not summit at all a  km hike up and down in vain in the dark after waking at am and spending  idrthe queue of hikers was very long and once the hike started in earnest there was such a jam that in this tough terrain one moved one foot and then had to wait till the queue moved forward another foot due to the narrow track and the scree it was slow going in the dark we all had torches and not at all fun because of the sheer numbers the hike itself is also not easy and without the numbers one might enjoy that challenge  but even this was denied ussince the queue moved so slowly we didn reach the summit in time for the promised sunrise view we waited at a vantage point to see it well below the summitafter the sunrise though our guides didnt offer to take us upto the summit at all when we insisted they grumpily said ok but were not happy the group was being split amongst those going up and those not so ultimately we didnt climb up then we were whizzed down an easy track down the mountain to our van there was little time to enjoy the scenery in a lovely place or appreciate the views the annoyance stems from the fact that there is an easy track that motorcycles use you can pay to be taken up close to the summit  or down which is broad quite easy to walk but these tour operators do not take hikers up this track and insist on that traffic choked narrow hike that may not result in summittingthis easy path is a continuation of an asphalt road that you walk a long for a km or  from the van parking ground where hikers are made to turn left and climb a scree filled dirt track the asphalt road continues to the right before turning into a level and decent dirt track whcih we came down laterit seems that the tour operators collude with the bike riders in keeping the hikers off this easy track else few people would hire the bikers the guides who take you up the mountain do not guide  they speak little english tell you almost nothing about the mountain region or much of anything they do offer you help in the uphilldownhill should you need it which to be fair is really nice these guides are not part of the tour company but belong to an association that has a stranglehold and have to be usedthere are other lovely things to do in bali why exhaust yourself waste money on this pity that a gorgeous place and what could be a wonderful experience is ruined by the greed of the operators and guides,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
1.0,out hotel kamojang jimbaran arranged this trip for us we paid usd  for our trip transport guide breakfast we stayed in jimbaran and we were picked up at am the driver was almost half hour late only then were we told that we were picking up  other passengers before heading to the hiking starting point we had to squeeze in with larger size passengers not sure why we pay so much and be treated with no comfortwhen we arrived at the hiking point our driver showed us to our guide who was going to guide all  of us we started our ascent with the guide walking in front of the lot of us half and hour from the start i needed a break so i stopped my friend stopped along but the guide did not see me stop so they continued we then continued to climb and found our group waiting we continued to gather again and i needed a short break once again when the group continued again in the end we had to climb by ourselves and were surrounded by new guide they expected us to pay them who wanted to take us to the top since our paid guide did not wait for us we said no and continued hiking we reached the top way before sunrise so we didnt understand why they rushed up without enjoying the scenery and the starsthe guide told us to come u standing at the top without telling us which path to use which caused me to fall and scratch my palms because of the distractionwe were made to sit and wait for sunrise and were only served plain bread and steamed egg we had to crack the shell ourselves with dirty handswe asked the guide if we were going up to the crater he said yes after sunrise but only took us to the crater at the level below and did not bring us up to the highest point it was a disappointmentwe then began decent and we were left to trail behind once again by the guide who walked up front and didi not check on the people behind it became worse when other groups walked fast in front of us and got into the queue which made us behind even more we keep walking down ourselves and it was hard the stone was slippery we carefully made our way down and found the group down at the level path the guide did not do anything in helping us decent he had poor skills to guide peoplehe only decided to walk with us once we reached the bottom and had  km to the gatesas we understand mt batur can only be hiked with guides but what happens if our guide leaves usour guides name was nadi and he is not fit to guide did not deserve any penny we paid,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,beautiful trip we walk fast so  hour top  hour back its cold on top so bring a jacket some warm clothes sunrise about  am  and it was jus amazing the guide with small breakfast about   local currency,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
2.0,my husband and i went on this trek which was stated as slightly challenging but since we are ok in terms of fitness we booked it we were also going to the hot springs afterwardswe booked it with gyg and when we got there it was pitch black and we were given torches there was a squat hole toilet at that point but thats it we walked through farmers fields and it started off ok however after a short while it became very sandy and gravelly and was very difficult to walk at that point the slope of the hill started to increase to eventually a  degree angle for  hours of the  hour hike i would say and this was a mixture of sand which was very hard to walk on never mind climb and rock climbing where i felt sometimes i was going to fall backwards the view at the place we stopped that was of the sunrise was amazing i have to say it was breathtaking the descent was also breathtaking but for very different reasons imagine trying to descend  degree slopes made entirely of sand and gravel i fell twice and cut myself and twisted my knee and the guide did nothing and didnt show any concern at all by the time we got down we were incredibly exhausted traumatised from the ordeal of walking down and up  even though we couldnt get to the summit so much so that we couldnt face going to the hot springs we just wanted a shower back at our hotel and to collect our thoughts after researching this i found out the main route the tourists are supposed to take is a simple hike with a flat area half way with a coffee shop etc this made me so mad because it was what i was looking forward to the most on our honeymoon  hours away from home and the experience was ruined because whichever company gyg chose took us up the wrong wayif you want a very challenging hike go the back way however if you want to make it up there to the top and see the view the main tourist way is best,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,a active volcano and chance for telling to same get up early and enjoy this opportunity of lifetime,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,the sunrise was fantastic over lake batur with mount agung in the background it did feel like queuing up the mountain however as it really is that popular whilst guides are all extremely friendly and helpful and the path not too challenging it didnt quite feel like a trek which was a bit disappointing,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,highly recommend we climbed with  children one is a  years oldwe love everything about it such a wonderful view from the top and such a magical space to enjoy and share with family ,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,we were picked up at our hotel at  am by our private driver we arrived at abt  am at the foot of mount batur where we were already expected by our private guide especially for the mount batur the climb is quite heavy certainly not for beginners not only up but descend is heavy also due to my bad fitness conditions i was glad i could use the suzuki driving me up to the top almost just  min walk to the top it costs extra money but for people who are in bad fitness condition and like to experience magnificent and breathtaking view on the sunrise and the mount agung its worthwhile i certainly recommend this although i have learned from our guide that we were lucky with the weather as it is not for sure when you are at the top that you will see the sunrise due the bad weather conditions not only the sunrise is fantastic but you can see the crater and hot steam geysers certainly one of the top three things to do in bali,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,we did not opt for trekking mount batur but instead decided to get our driver to drive us up to kintamani to watch the sunrise from there we started at  am it took a good  hours to get there along a narrow winding road we reached around  am we waited until  am when the sun started to first show its colorsit was a bit chilly at the top so be prepared with hats scarves and jacketsthere was cloud cover so we didnt have a spectacular sunrise but we did get beautiful views of the three mountains mount batur agung and abang and we saw the early morning hikers making their way up mount batur  i dont think they had a better view than us and we were comfortably watching as we didnt have to hoof it up with all the other hikers so this was a much more comfortable way to see the sunriseafter that we had a delicious buffet breakfast at the amora see separate review where we had even more breathtaking views of the mountainsyou must go early though to see the mountains because by  am the fog sets in and obscures all views,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
2.0,this is a huge tourist trap we went on a tour as it seems to be impossible without one due to the mafia the walk up was not too hard it is a straight forward path however a few generally unfitsmokers did struggle the walk however was hugely ruined by the amount of people you are head to toe with the person in front everyone has to go at the same speed as there are so many people the guide said about  people do it everyday it is ridiculous at the top the view was average especially for indonesia we have seen far better sights the breakfast was not as described no cooking food in volcanoes etc just some eggs banana and bread its also horrific going back as all the tourists go at once it takes forever to get back to ubud ijenbromoberastagi are far better dont waste your money and support the mafia guides,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,i was very unsure about my ability to do this climb as there are many different views as to whether this is challenging or not im  ft kgs overweight moderate fitness and i found it challenging if you are not used to climbingwalking inclines you need to prepare physically do dome practice climbsstairs and you will be much better off bring a spare shirt as you will get drenched in your own sweat on the way to the summit and yes the wind chill is harshnow thats been said please note you will be rewarded with a spectacular view and great feeling of accomplishment many friendly coclimbers of all nationalities makes for a great vibe and the photo opportunities are endless we had a great guide who added to the funbe prepared for the worlds saddest egg sandwich and one hell of a sunrise,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,the view from the top as the sun was rising was breathtaking definitely worth the intensive climb to the top you can see how the sun rises and shines over the oceanbe advise to that is not an easy climb could get very challenging to reach the top the path gets very steep and narrow,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,it was a good experience but my first time ever climbing a mountain warning it is not for all skill levels  it said that it is for beginners and experienced climbers but my mum and i struggled and is not suitable for beginners the instructor was nice and helpful i couldnt appreciate the sunset because i was so tired and it was freezing up there bring snacks if you are going to do it because you need a lot of energy overall im glad i did it and i can tick climb up a mountain off my bucket list but i definitely wont be doing anything like that again,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,be prepared for an extremely early alarm callno sleep if you want to witness the sunrise from the top of mount baturdepending on your tour operator and location you are likely to be picked up from your accommodation at  am before being driven to the foot of the  meter mountainyou walk in darkness your guide will provide torches and for those bravelazy enough you can hop on the back of a dirt bike and be taken to within  minutes of the summitwe opted to walk the first stretch of the path is gentle enough a moderate incline with soft volcanic earth underfoot the final stretch is more challenging but it is a short stretch only and people of all shapes sizes and ages made it to the top depending on your speed you then have a wait if  to  and a half hours before the spectacular sunrise at am offering stunning view of clouds and one of balis largest lakes below and the island of lombok over the ocean in the distancefurther up the mountain are hot steam geysers and a great view of the crater of mount batur the walk down in daylight is altogether easier and takes less than one hour if you get a move onan incredible way to start the day and unforgettable view,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,i looked at the clock and it was pm i had my alarm set on my phone for am with our driver picking us up at am we were setting off from our hotel on the north east coast of bali to climb mount batur the alarm went off and after what seemed like a very a brief power nap sam and i gathered our things locked up our room and took a short walk to collect our pre made breakfast box and water from the hotel receptionbefore our scheduled am pickup still half asleep i asked the driver to find me an atm machine en route sam and i dived in the back and off we went the roads were deserted at that time of the morning we began to weave and climb up through the narrow streets the driver pushing the small suzuki vehicle to its maximum effort some of the roads were very steep with hairpin bends it was not for the nervous passenger after driving for a short time the driver pulled up next to an atm where i used my trusty starling bank card to withdraw the  idr  approx  idr which i needed to pay the guide for their services and entrance fee onto the mountain cash in my wallet i jumped back in the suzuki and the driver continued we arrived at what i could only be described as a checkpoint in the road where officialsguides from the mountain were flashing torches directing our vehicle to someone where we would pay the entrance fee i gave my money to our driver who in turn took care of the payment waved through the checkpoint we soon arrived at a carpark which would act as the rvp and the place where tourists would meet there designated guidethe carpark area was bustling with people i used the toilet facilities before we were introduced to out guide a very fit and slim looking  year old who didnt waste any time on introductions i put my backpack on my back slung my smaller bag with camera and gropro round my front off we went setting a brisk pace the guide gave sam and i a torch each as we headed up a narrow tarmac road the road was lined by farmers fields growing onions and various other vegetables i was worried about the pace that was being set as sam was a novice to mountains i could see that she was beginning to worry and the look of panic on her face was evident it was pitch black and the guide was beginning to shine his torch up at the mountain i hadnt done too much research prior to booking the excursion and the hotel reception described it as a fun walk the silhouette of the mountain up ahead of us looked like a challenging climb it was at this point sam to her credit said to the guide that it was beyond her capabilities i could see that sam was upset but knowing what i know now it was definitely the right decision the guide and sam headed back so that sam could wait with the driver and maybe catch up on some sleep the guide and i agreed that i would tag on to the back of the next group of people i caught up with and that i would meet him at the half way point which he stated would be very obvioushead down i started to set a good pace myself and soon caught up with a group in front they were a french family and i could read their faces their faces were saying who is this random guy tagging on to the back of our group i explained my situation and luckily they spoke and understood english which helped the climb itself was becoming steeper and the ground underfoot was becoming challenging it was definitely starting to give the leg muscles and my lungs a good workout i could see that we had reached the very obvious halfway point it had a concreted flattened area where a lady and her children were beginning to set up their stall they were selling drinks chocolate bars energy gels and other confectionary perfect for climbers burning through the calories i explained to the french family and their guide that i would be waiting for my guide to catch me up i waited for about five minutes and my guide suddenly appeared from nowhere that was quick i thought to myself i asked him if sam was okay he said yes she is okay she is going to sleep i was worrying a little as i was in a foreign country sam was with the driver who we only just met and i was continuing up this ft mountain i said to the guide i have completed mountain races in the past as well as running ultra marathons so i wanted to challenge myself and push on up the mountain okay no problem he said as he set offsetting a lung busting pace and hardly breaking sweat we soon passed the french family which shouts of gonewcastle as we powered past them the ground was becoming steeper and more gruelling the guide was beginning to make me work hard and was starting to pull away up ahead passing more climbers with every stride he would occasionally look round to see if i was still in contact i always had him in sight and would give him a thumbs up to indicate that i was okay and to keep going it was still dark i looked back down the mountain and could see a long snaking line of torches from the hundreds of other people who were now attempting the climb below the wind was also picking up as we gained altitude the guide turned to me with a smile on his face and said only  minutes to the top maybe even less the gradient was steep and the consistency of the ground underfoot was of a powder like dust which made it a challenge for my white saucony running shoes which were now a dirty shade of grey after a short while we reached the summit the guide turning to me and give me a high five and a big hug i looked at my garmin watch and it displayed hr mins as i hit the stop button i showed the guide and he appeared very happy he said normally it takes the average person  hours  maybe more i was happy with thatthe wind at the summit was strong and it was blowing up the dust from the tracks and was difficult to keep out of my eyes i tried to use my sunglasses to block the dust but it didnt appear to work i also began to feel at bit of a chill as i was cooling down and the sweat was beginning to dry i only had a thin long sleeve fleece top on with my shorts we were the first handful of people to reach the top of the mountain so we could find a seat inside the small shelter i sat next to two french girls who again spoke very good english we chatted about bali and other places we had visited in the world as well as sams travel blog they made a note of sams instagram and twitter handles the guide ordered me a coffee with two sugars in the black coffee came in a long glass and was delicious just what i needed to warm up as i gazed out towards the horizon and sea the sky was just beginning to change colour an orange hint intensifying with every minute was estimated sunrise time according to google we had nearly two hours to wait i was thinking to myself i wish i had brought another jacket i looked out from the small shelter and more people were beginning to arrive at the top there was a lot of younger people who looked like students who were travelling the world there was also group of indonesian teenagers who were on a school expedition they were buzzing with their effort at reaching the top they held up their national flag to toast their achievement i love that i thought to myselftime was ticking closer to sunrise and the sky was beginning to get to a very noteworthy orange enough to justify getting the camera and gopro ready i captured some great pictures and videos i spent a lot of time people watching i also thought to myself how many people maybe didnt make it to the top of this challenging m climb i have done many races in snowdonia in wales the race was over a  mile course where you climb seven ft peaks it was challenging batur was over ft and was definitely more difficult in terms of gradient and i wouldnt say fun is how you would describe itthe guide took my obligatory mountain top photos the sun now fully up i scanned the mountain top and would estimate  people were now observing the sunrisei didnt want to be at the back of the long line heading back down the mountain so i turned to the guide and said lets go using my arms to indicate to run back down he smiled and off we went we reached the half way point in  minutes when the guide said he needed to take his moped back to the rvp we clambered over some rocks to discover a small parking area of mopeds lined up i then discovered that there was a guides track that led from the half way point back to the rvp carpark no wonder he managed to meet me at half way so quickly we both hopped on the moped and he blasted us down the track gopro in hand as we manoeuvred down the track it was now daylight and was noticeably warmer the beauty of the foothills were amazing as i looked back the mountain was standing in all its glory i definitely felt a sense of achievement as i stepped of the moped my legs definitely knew that they had just climbed a mountainback at the suzuki i knocked on the window and was relieved that sam hadnt been kidnapped she was looking a lot fresher than me after a sleep i discovered that the driver and sam had been for breakfast in one of the local cafes sam said that it was delicious the driver was impressed at the speed of our climb and descent i used the facilities once more before making our journey back to the hotel the scenery on the way back was something else i will remember batur and i am glad i took on the challenge my advice to others would be to pack a jacket and maybe some warmer clothing for the time you are at the summit take it from me that it is challenging and isnt for the faint hearted i would question anyone who thinks it is easy you have to have quite a good level of fitness as it does test the legs and lungs we even made it back to the hotel in time for breakfast,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
2.0,we climbed mount batur this morning and we have a very divided opinion about this experiencealready at home i read on the internet that it is practically impossible to climb the volcano without a guide because there is a kind of a guide mafia since we didnt want any problems we booked a tour on the mount batur with a guide for  dollars per person on the internetat  am a very nice driver picked us up punctually in ubud afterwards we were taken to a kind of office where several people offered jackets and sweaters actually we didnt want to support this but since i didnt have the right clothes i decided for a jacket on the summit i was very happy about it because it is really cold and windy renting the jacket costed  ird around  dollars in the office we got to know our guide quickly after we started to hike we noticed that it is not a comfortable natureloving hike as we expected because there are dozens of motorcyclists who want to turn a taxi upwards not only do you have to step on your side all the time the motorcycles cause terrible air the riders transport you almost to the top so that you only have to walk about  minutes to the summit in fact there are some tourists who gratefully accept the offer completely incomprehensible this has nothing more to do with nature and hiking the crowds would not have disturbed us but these motorcycles leave us with a bitter aftertaste as far as we know there ist another way to the top where the motorbikes cant ride but that one is much more exhausting and almost the same length in timewhen we reached the top some people were already sitting on the benches the different guides probably have their fixed benches where their customers can sit our guide then brought us a hot drink and asked us to come and see how he makes eggs for us he put the eggs in the hole of the crater after  minutes the eggs were cooked and our breakfast was ready in addition to the eggs there was unroasted toast with banana pieces in betweenthe view on the volcano is beautiful for this view it is definitely worthwhile to climb the volcanohowever there is absolutely no guide necessary you can also find the way by yourself it is not dangerous we felt a little bit controlled by the guide it is a pity that this has developed in such a way that one cannot climb up without a guide,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,the beauty of the volcano has been spoilt by the littering and dirtiness at the top the walk up is not enjoyable due to the constant stream of motorbikes going up and down pestering walkers to jump on for a ride  at a cost of course the dust they kicked up is hard on the eyes and lungs especially if youre walking up in the dark to catch the sunriseit costs  to use the toilet which is appalling given you cannot traverse the volcano on your own  you must use and pay for a guide,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,like many people we did the sunrise hike we got picked up at our hotel at  am and hiked for  miles up a steep rocky slippery trail the trail was crowded and people were loud but when the sun started to rise it was all completely worth it great experience,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,we headed up at  am we did not encounter the harassing locals that others have mentioned however we did use a local guide jordan who we got through good bali driver we had been hearing from locals how cold it is on that way up for perspective we are from chicago and they are from bali i was pulling clothes off along the way it might get a little cool once at the top and wait for the sunrise but really its fine you should be fit to attempt this several people looked exhausted early into this hike upour guide was telling people often turn around we used flashlights and they were definitely need as this does turn into a rock scramble good shoes a must the hike up is a wonderful experience but it is very crowded and gets worse going downthink bottleneck however just the experience the view the steam the monkeys some idiot brought a drone that sort of cut into the peacefulness the clouds blocked the sun but we knew it was out there its was our th anniversary and a great way to celebrate it,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,beautiful mountain this place make you feel free and the weather very cold if the night i suggest you stay in your hotelguest house wkwkwk,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,amazing experience to climb to see the sunrise but like every other review says its standstill traffic for literally hours incredible view but youll be sharing it with hundreds of othersid read heaps of reviews and thought id be prepared not so muchhighlights it really is a stunning view for a good chunk of time once you reach the summit its not a case of walk up take a few photos for insta and wander back down you see some incredible changes in light and colour i was fortunate to have fantastic weather as well the guides are friendly like all balinese and incredibly helpful when it comes to helping you up and back down im sure all tour companies are similarreality checks you are nose to tail the entire way from the drive to the base to walking all the way to the summit we tourists we really do ruin everything our guide told us more than  people climb a day if you havent done any regular exercise in the last year or so its not going to be a walk in the park there are some clambering sections and given that it is so crowded not everyone understands etiquette and they are looking out for their own safety you really do have to concentrate its a solid two hour climb and probably an hour return its dark take a head torch the guides go at a pretty reasonable pace and its consistent be prepared to not be the dawdler in the group however the guides are incredibly generous with stops and checking on everyone wear good clothing and shoes so important its loose gravel dirt and pointy rocks of various sizes all the way up and back its not a  jeans and converse kind of activity so if you didnt pack anything active youre gonna have a bad time i underestimate how cool it was at the base and the summit so wear a hoodie and be prepared to carry it once you need to strip it off there will inevitably be some idiot with a drone or a speaker blaring awful musing as there is at every tourist attraction ruining the serenity at the top or along the path be prepared to be in a crowd just a dark trekking crowdin all honesty its quite incredible at the top and you feel quite accomplished when youre done,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,this is a fairly easy climb but there are so many people doing it there can be traffic people jams going up and down the views of the sunrise and surrounding area are amazing and make it worth the early start and the number of people there are other hikes on the island that are a lot quieter if you want did it with a ten year old and she was absolutely fine with the climb,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,great views and good foodlove itif u ride down from the village u can visit the hotsprings aswell,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,i did a less common trip which was the combined sunset and sunrise tour on airbbthe trek up was done at the much more respectable time of pm in daylight it is not an easy trek but even though im not exactly the fittest person around i made it in about  hours this allowed plenty of time to have a drink and snack at the top get the camera gear out and find the best spot for sunset photos at this time there were about  people up the volcano all there for the sunset and to see the thermal vents which are very cool not in e temperature way thoughcamping over night there were  others plus guides and the food was great  fresh fish from the lake below the volcanoin the morning i left my tent  minutes before sunrise and it was cloudy however this didnt stop me noticing the several hundred my guide estimated a usual  people who had trekked up for the sunrise being that the top was far to crowded especially with instagrammers doing fish pouts and v signs i wandered back to my tent about ft blow them and got some shots of the sun when the cloud eventually clearedwe waited for the crowds to move on to the thermal vents and take their turn whilst we make our way back down the volcano in peace an quiet and in much less time than it took to get up ittotally worth doing unfortunately my guide was not a weather god and cloud is a big risk but in between the clouds the views are spectacular you just have to bear with it and keep your fingers crossed,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,we booked a private hiking tour from klook at mount baturthe hike was very tough for us as we are not sporty people started our hike from around am and reached at the peak at close to amfirst of all the weather is pretty chilly at the mountain so cover up its around  degrees rental of jackets are available at k idrwe had an awesome guide to watch over us throughout and making sure that we are alright we hiked to mid point and decided to get transport up to the peak motorcycle rides are available at k idr per pax to bring you up to peak from mid point with very experienced driversdefinitely a once in a lifetime experience challenging but worth it having a good rest and massage is a must after the hike ,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,succumbed to the hype surrounding sunrise hike of mount batur and im glad we did our kids age    had a great time hiking this volcanic mountain as well id rate the hike moderate one we finished it in about  hrswe started at am from our hotel in ubud and reached the parking lot at am met our guide and started hiking around am we were at the top by  and were able to catch the sun rise views of the lakes and mountains of balibreakfast up at the top is nothing to write home about so carry your snacks and water please avoid taking plastic bottles from the vendors  guideannoying part are all the mountain bikes that constantly keep going up and down the mountain to lure you into using them to climb instead of walking the noise is awful so try and take the steeper route if you can there are no bikes on that route,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,from reading the reviews its obvious that the two different routes up the volcano illicit v different reactions so pick when booking your trip find out which route your guide intends to takei took the route up without motorbikes but i descended using this route so i know what its likethe route up i took is hard its like  hours on the stair master with loose gravel around you you need a good level of fitness for this route if your fitness level is not good enough or you have dodgy joints there is the dusty route with lower gradients but you will have to contend with the bikesthe views and sense of achievement are great,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,we are a couple in our late twenties who are currently doing a backpacking trip around the world so as you can imagine were on a tight budget as a result the cost per person we were quoted for a guided tour of the volcano was extortionate to us so we decided to do it alonebest decision ever we drove ourselves day for scooter rental to a place called toyabungkah once we got there people kept asking where we were going and if we wanted a guide for  ppwe declined but you do a get a feeling like youre being watched unfortunately we then just looked on google maps and found the mt batur car park so chanced heading therewe hadnt been there  minutes before some local demanded we have a guide and said his boss was coming to speak to us etc etc we refused and said we know no guide was needed that it was a scam and to leave us alone he was persistent so i then asked for his official government id which i knew he didnt have and he had no answer to thiswe left our bike with a lady who ran one of the stalls and gave a small tip for looking after the bike and also bought drinks off her after the hikewe climbed up along the ridge following brokendead grass but there is a pathway up to get to the pathway go to the temple up on the left building works are going on here when facing the temple you have a fab lake view to the left then to the right are a pile of blocks climb over these blocks and walk left around the templesoon you will see the pathway and this leads you all the way to the top and goes around about to slippery in parts so make sure you hold on to strong rocks etc didnt take us long to reach the top coming from this part so maybe the guided tours start further away im not sureanyways we made it to the top with no one else hassling us and the views were incredible we did it at around am so im not sure what it would be like earlier if you want to catch sunrise but im glad we picked this time as we only met two other tourists the entire time so it was like having the place to ourselves maybe we were incredibly lucky but wanted to share for anyone on a budget that still wants to hike this ,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,its quite hard for solo traveler like me to book from online tour so here is the tip for anyone who did a solo trip and want to join other group sharing tour like what it has been said in the forumn you can book the trip the day before on a tour booth at ubud street just go for one asked for batur trekking trip and asked the price i got it for idr k the price include pick up and drop off from your hotel ubud area brrakfast  times pancake banana before the trekking and egg sandwich at summit mineral water the driver will asked if we already bring our water or not guide for trekking ticket retribution kperson the driver pick up us around am and it took  hour to reach kintamani area the trekking start right away after we arrived please go to toilet first before the trekking and i suggest it to go to the cafe where we get our early breakfast rather than at batur you need to pay k for toilet trekking take  hours for up and another  hour for the way down after trekking there will be a short stop for coffee plantation but you can ask the driver to skip it and going right away to our hotel the whole tour end at  am as our group decided to skip coffee plantationabout the view from summit  it was breathtaking and almost magical this trip was just made my day we couldnt see the sunrise because it was cloudy but still the view is just worth all the sweat and hard breath i got because the trekking it was not the hard one but i would not say it easy too and dont forget to bring your jacket it was a freezeing at the top,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,this place is around a hr  drive to kintamani from say the down town kuta  on the way you can visit factories making stone statutes  silver jewellery which they say is more important in their social being than gold also painting factories etc and then proceed to the mountwe were recommended the sari mountain view restaurant which virtually the last on the road and has i think the finest views along with abundance of tables in the restaurant on the roof top the place has a veg indian food on the gr level and the lower level the roof with a nonveg buffet which is amazing sumptuous and very reasonably priced you can hire a taxi for a full day from klook and they are well priced hire it for the day and visit the other places like the factories mount batur ubud famous for the bebeko a duck dishit is fascinating to see a volcano which is marked as active but has not erupted for may be  decades their is a beautiful lake next to the mount and looks beautiful you can have a trekking trip also and see the sunrise from the mount baturi would positively recommend that a trip to this place is a wonderful outing,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,through a friend we learned of a large bali tour company called suta tours that can customize tours to fit your needs having read of persons who had combined sunrise trekking of batur with rafting and coffee plantation visit for a looooooong day our group of  felt up to the task and arranged with suta to offer all three activities same day one immediately following the other we were picked up from our kuta resort at  am for the drive to batur trailhead start   note ubud is closer to batur so on hindsight we would have had a bit more rest had we begun in ubud rather than kuta although on arrival there were already small groups assembled and preparing to make the trek it was the first wave  plus off season so we were not slowed up by anyone as we made the ascent with our guide  enny we brought our own headlamps  preferable to torches aka flashlights the trek up is challenging and there were persons who were clearly strugglingsome tour companies even set age limits because of this but suta had no problem with our ages   of us are definitely in the  senior yet fit category  it was cloudy at the top  nature and weather after all are unpredictabie so no lava spews were obvious but the views were still magnificent enny prepared us boiled eggs in a volcanic crevice and also banana sandwiches plus hot cocoa from there we headed to a coffee plantation where we got to try the famed luwak coffee  poop as well as some milder sweeter coffees and teaswe were happy that the live luwak we saw were not in tiny cages as some reviewers have mentioned and appeared to not being showing signs of stress in their enclosure from there we were taken to the steep staircase that took us down to the water for our whitewater rafting experience i am emphasizing the steepness of the stairs down and that there are dozens as one person had to be arm escorted down starting at the halfway point i have no idea what they did for her at the conclusion of the rafting when one had to climb more stairs up although not as many if you have any kind of knee issues or ambulation problem in general this option is not for you the rafting was fun but at  minutes and after a looong day the deliberate smashing into other rafts by the guides resulting in everyone getting soaked was irritating and unwelcoming to me but i was clearly in the minority with that opinion i had mistakenly believed at class  and  it would be more  calm and scenery soaking  the scenery evokes images of jurassic park once brought back to the rafting company headquarters we feasted on a yummy included buffet  much needed after al the physical challenges of the day we were delivered back to our resort after almost  hours a very tired but immensely satisfied group at  us a person we felt this to be an incredible deal not only did we have fun but we felt safe throughout all of our activities,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,the sunrise is incredible so do that but make sure you get a tour of the other craters too the trekking is a little more challenging but the views and the experience are worth it,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,i finally did the mt batur sunrise hike and it was spectacular so glad i did it and would recommend it for anyone with moderate level of fitness it was definitely a steady steep but luckily was not wet or slippery when we did it which worked to our advantage the path was pretty straightforward up to a certain point near the top after which for the next  yards or so near the top it gets super tricky with huge rocks for those who bailed out ob hiking halfway through there are motorcycle riders who take them for a cost but the last  yards are not accessible by motorcycles i had to be on all fours here sometimes the guides were super helpful literally lending a hand as needed so with their help i made it to the top what a view the hues of dawn were truly magical we could see mt rinjani in lombok and mt agung from there the fact that you get to stare right into the crater is truly amazing we even went to the part where they boil eggs from the heat of the crater do dress in layers as i was soaking wet from sweat on the way up and took off my jacket but was freezing when i stopped hiking at the top and had to put the jacket back onif you are in bali  a definite must do if you visit bali,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
2.0,not a good area to be visited as we have to pay to cross the road to get to batur then we have to pay again to trek the mountain too much tourist and rubbish with the collection of money from the tourist the organizer doesnt pay attention to it,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,we had heard lots of different things about mount batur and wether we should do it alone or with a guide in the end we found bazir was the man to use   he was lovely patient and took us a different route which avoided all the other guides the climb was a little tough but only because i literally never climb just run and lift weightsi can see what people mean about the mountain mafia although the locals we came across were lovely some of them definitely seemed a bit dodgy yes its not right that you should be forced to use a guide but for the sake of doing it properly you might as well,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,it was an early am hike from the bottom to catch the sunrise the hike was not enjoyable as you have to share the difficult trail with tons of motorbikes spewing pollution in the thin air while you needed fresh oxygensunrise at the top was breathtaking but it was also very crowded,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,the trek is easy and the view from the top is amazing therefore there are hundreds of tourists going up at  am to see the sunrise at  am thats good for tourism business but it is a pity for the site the top of the volcano has been equipped with benches like in a cinema and you can buy coffee and tea in the small shops we miss the wild nature and dont forget that it is a volcano that has already erupted several times,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
1.0,having read online that you do not need a guide to trek up to mount batur i decided save some cash and drive  walk up it myself however when i arrived at the trail entrance around  i was immediately stopped by a group of locals posing as guides at a gate and told i would have to pay  rupee for a guide and that it wasnt possible to do it on my own knowing that they were trying to scam me i attempted to just push past but they grabbed my backpack and surrounded me with no way past as i wasnt going to fight a group of locals i attempted to skirt around the outside of the entrance however they patrolled the area and caught me and began calling me a terrorist and many other things eventually it escalated to death threats when i ignored them and kept climbing at which point i left just thought id give a warning to any solo travellers,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,you need to hire a guide to ascend the volcano best done for sunrise over bali woke up at am its a hr drive from denpasar started hiking around am to catch the sunrise wear proper hiking shoes the terrain gets rough on the way up especially the nd half i recommend bringing a small headlamp if you have so you arent bothered with holding a flashlight during the ascension at dawn its dark for the most part you will get stunning views of the other volcano mount agung facing mount batur as well as lake batur on the slopes of the volcano watching the sunrise from atop mount batur is majestic most tourists will have breakfast at the top of the mountain i was grossed out to see how tourists are inconsiderate  filthy pick up your trash after dont let the locals do it its about a hr hike way to reach the summit you have to be in decent physical shape to climb up this was definitely a highlight of my trip to bali,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
1.0,we drove there by ourselves in the middle of the night its a mountain on no mans land so no trekking guide should be permittedwe were followedtraced and forced by a lot of locals who were trying to sell their trekking guide tours to us not interested then they told us that they hate tourists like us just because we dont wanna spend money on their horrible trekking rip off dealsafter we went to the foot of the mountain our lives were threathenes by a group of so called guides they keep kicking and punching us from behind even though we were running away after that we finaly got back to our bikes and we got ambushed even more by the locals this was a horrible experience and i sure hope no one will ever go there to spend their money on this horrible balinese sharade,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,the volcano is truly a sight to behold it looks so magnificent far away you can only imagine how it looks like up close a mindsmacking experience honestly,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,if youre in bali this is a mustdo especially if you love hiking its a tad far away from everything and requires waking up early but itll be so damn worth ithonestly you dont really need a guide to navigate for this because the trails so popular you just need to follow everyone else and their guides we had a guide though and the extra bonus was that he knew the lesscrowded spots and also how to chase away the naughty monkeys  just lift a rock  and some extra fun facts about the areawhat i noticed was that so many people were in inappropriate hiking attire  think shorts denim jackets and white sneakers so heres a packing list of the things you need torchlight  its pitch black other than the torches of other people proper hiking shoes  we saw many people sliding especially on the way down the volcanic sand is slippery wear long pants  before the sun rises its cold a sweater and windbreaker  it gets warm on the way up but it gets chilly waiting for the sun to risei brought gloves up but didnt use them at allon top of all that we were in bali for a whole week but didnt see any shops selling hiking shoes so make sure to bring those from home,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,every climb is different every sunrise is different but still absolutely beautiful definitely worth the climb,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,our driver picked us up at am from seminyak to arrive to the place by am we only had a demin jacket and shorts on this hike and it was freezing we did not get warned about the temperature of this hike i highly recommend pants jumper long socks and good running shoes the breakfast includes  boiled egg and bread with banana and if you want coffee you will need to pay for this the hike was very steep and fitness level needs to be moderatehigh a lot of travelers in our group ended up paying  aud for a motorbike to drive up the volcano the view was amazing but very cold and windy i would only recommend to people who have a good fitness level it was ok,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,so i was totally unfit and underdressed for this adventure i walk regularly do my steps this is uphill climb for  hours at my pace be advisedon my defense i have a bad knee but love to adventureso halfway up i gave up i was just gonna sit in the forest amongst the trees by the way it is cold i was wearing jeans and a tshirt and a shirt over the tshirt and a sarong as a scarf over my head and was cold when not in motion i come from a warm climate some people were in shorts crazies anyway there were mountain bikes there  up from the halfway point and  down i was saved we made it and what a thrill ride we hadjust walking amongst the tree canopy was so fun but now on a bike yipeeeee so to those of you who still want to enjoy this adventure and are in no shape bike up they drop you off about  minutes steep uphill climb from the top but already above cloud level so you can choose to continue to the top or admire the sunrise up up up the mountainloved it highly recommend,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,just being here i could have just stayed here all day total bliss the air up there and the view surrounding us was all i needed i think i was almost the highest point and from where i sat looking out at the volcano it was just breath taking the feeling i got being there was indescribable our driver took us here unknown to us and we welcomed the visit with open arms we had lunch on the balcony of the restaurant amora overlooking the volcano beautiful and breathtaking the food here from the buffet was ok although burners were under each food it tasted cold i must say the service here was that of a  restaurant i did try fried spinach for the very first time they were full of information and just wanted us to know all that they had to offer very attentive and very polite and accommodating the feeling was so exhilarating i loved being here and the surprise visit was one ill always remember ,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
1.0,watch out for locals trying to scam your money we went for a late morning trek to avoid the sunrise crowd got stopped along the way by a local with an expired  tour guide license claiming that we had to pay k idr to go up the mountain outrageous to try and scam tourists and ruin peoples experience of bali i understand life as a local might be challenging but its all about money money money for these people we ended up driving to a more legitimate agency and the guide brought us up and left us to find our way out at the bottom of the mountain agree with the below comment not a good experience and not worth the hassle,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
1.0,we tried to find out how to do it without a guide because its quite an expense for just  hours of hike around  thats when the word mafia started to appear some people had really bad experience because of that and in the end we did like most people do booking a tour with a guide including a breakfast at the top with hot drinkwe woke up at  am i was worried about the cold since i dont have any warm clothes when i mentioned my concern to the office girl and asked if i could borrow a jacket she told me that my thin sweater would be more than enough and i understand now why she told me that because as soon as we started locals were trying to sell us jackets of course its better if i payas we reached the first stop i witnessed an altercation between  indonesian guides and a tourist the latter was walking alone on the path and apparently one of the guide hit him with his motorbike the three guides stood against the tourist accusing him of injuring their friend the tourist tried to explain himself  to no avail  and showed them that he was injured on the leg too he got kicked in this leg twice by one of the guide that was obviously furious against him the tourist got kicked out of the entrancei highly suspect that this guy didnt take any guide and locals will never let you pass without one even if it means using verbal and physical abuse i was shocked i started to understand the word mafia actually you pay for a guide not because the path is dangerous and difficult but because the locals are dangerous for you if you dont take onepatrols of locals were passing everywhere surveying people alone after reading some reviews after my experience i realised that it can go very far some tourists being threatened to be killed if they didnt pay for a guide and its not just about the guides all the locals are involved in this business and if you are seen alone youll get pursued all the way and threatened until you either go back home or pay there is no way out if you want to go if you just want to walk up a simple mountain its definitely not normal it really is a mafia i regret my choice because by paying i allowed this sick business to go onand the hike is easy one path crowded by guides ours was useless and made the trip very annoying because you cant go at your own pace the guy would wait everytime for the slowest to follow very annoying for the fastest very pressuring for the slowestthen can we talk about the fact that this volcano is indeed on the unesco list and you cross path with tons of motorbikes on the trail how good for the environment is that and not to mention the fact that we are hiking and have to endure the smell of fuel all the way up also having to stop to let them pass because they drive without caring about hikers and on top of that they dare sometimes stop and ask people if they need a ride to climb not free we are hikingarriving on top we discover our breakfast  pieces of plain toast  egg  banana when i asked about the coffee they offered they told me i have to pay for it of course its definitely freezing out there and a hot beverage is so tempting that most of the people cant resist and pay for it anywaythe sunrise is beautiful but honestly you can admire sunrises everywhere where its free where the site is well maintained and where there are no threats of being killed if you dont pay for a useless guidei asked to the guide if its on the unesco list how can motorbikes work herethe guide felt ill at ease and tried to avoid it by replying something like the motorbikes take the weakest person to the top its only twenty minutes drivei had no pleasure in climbing that volcano i participated into an horrible business where tourists are used as money spitters i am surprised to see so many good reviews about thispeople pay but nobody knows where your money is going and what for since the area doesnt look taken care of i repeat its just a sick business,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
1.0,this is by far the worst experience in bali also the worst hiking experience i ever hadif you read some reviews youll soon discover that you apparently need a guide to hike the mount batur we a group of three dont like to hike with a guide so i tried to figure out if we could do it without the reviews we read were not really reassuring mentioning a local mafia by need a guide what they mean is that they will not only verbally but also physically threaten you if you dont have one unfortunately we ended up booking one and i can say that i completely regret it to participate in this sick businessas we were hiking we stopped at a first station to rest there a guy didnt have a guide a motorbike crashed him on the way and both of them were injured this injured tourist tried to defend himself saying he was just walking and showed he was hurt to one of the guides and this guide kicked him in the injured leg twice it was extremely shocking then they took him to the beginning of the trackas you may have noticed i wrote motorbike apparently there are different tracks but on the one we were it was full of motorbikes on a unesco site so when your lungs are fully open youre gonna smell fuel not to mention that the paths are narrow so youll have to stop to let them pass they will also stop to ask you if you want a taxi we are hikingwe were a group of  with people we dont know and the guide waits for everyone so you cant have your own pace whether youre slow or fasta breakfast is provided for the top of the mountain which is a joke   slices of bread one boiled egg and a banana no hot beverage whereas we were told so but of course you have to pay for itlast but not least a guide is completely useless as theres no difficulty in this trek the path is completely noticeable and full of tourists with flashlight anyway so you just have to follow and if you take your time its far from being hard moreover at one point we got separated with our group so it was only me and the guide so anything could have happened to the rest of themeven if its one of the main attraction on bali please please do not participate in this disastrous hike its not profitable for anyone the sunrise might be pretty on the top sure but i really couldnt enjoy it and youll see as pretty sunrise anywhere else try to get your sunrise for free somewhere else youll do not only yourself a favour but also everyone,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,mount batur sunrise hiking tour starts at am in midnight depending upon your hotel location from where driver pickups you and you reach at zero point around am you should book a local guide a day before tracking starts at am total  km up and  km down it takes  hours one way depending upon your strength and speed local guide provides torch and water while hiking and breakfast at the top there is so cold atmosphere literally freezing at the zero point and the top so you need a jacketyou can buy a jacket or blanket on rent also there the breakfast contains bananas orangesboiled eggs and bread you can buy hot tea or coffee at high cost you must have good hiking shoes total itinerary from pickup guide waterbreakfast and drop back at hotel costs around  idr depending upon how you can bargain certainly not for elderly children and weak people because it is really tough challenging track but it is definitely worth when you see the views on the top which are really amazing and wonderful,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,not a trek for the faint heartedthe views are spectacular and were a highlight of our bali tripthe path to the top especially the last third is often difficult to climb scree underfoot makes walking treacherous  just as much so on the way downbe sure to wear good footwear take care and marvel at the panorama,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,many companies organize a sunrise trekking with breakfast to mount batur the trek is moderately difficult but the sunrise and views are simply amazing which i think is the best part of bali for me you can see forests lake greenery clouds two active volcanoes from here you spend about  minutes to go to top spend  hours at top with having breakfast and then come down i would strongly suggest this if you are in bali,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,it can be a little tough because of the loose rocks but the view is stunning expect loads of people climbing up with you all the travel agencies offer the same tour at the same time but once you get to the top theres plenty of space to everyone to sit and contemplate the sunrise,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,when we landed we then realised we have to pay kind of tax to be on that road as well as we have to eat in the resturant to see the peak and take pics else the ladies would surround you till you order however nice place to spend on,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,tip use a guide we fully recommend bazir     available on whatsappafter a painful am alarm with a few beers the night before and half way up the volcano i questioned whether it was all worth it even at am when wed reached the summit i was concerned whether itd be worth it but wow what an experience and something well never forget the views sunrise backdrop and atmosphere is totally worth the  hours of tiredness and exercisebazirs dad picked us up from seminyak at am he arrived early and waited for us after approximately a  hour drive north to batur where you can catch up on some sleep if required you arrive in the pitch black in the middle of nowhere at the base of mount batur bazirs dad is a lovely and friendly character and fills you with trust however you cant help wonder where youve arrived not a worry at all though as bazir arrives with flash lights and water and you quickly start the ascent bazir is chatty and friendly and guides you along the route very knowledgeable about the area and the tracks without a guide and in the pitch black youd have no idea on the route to the top the walk is difficult with rocky sections requiring a good level of fitness however bazir is very accommodating and provides plenty of stops on route to regain your breath the walk in total took is under  hours to get to the top leaving the base at around  and getting to the top just before am the sunrise was approximately amwhen at the summit bazir takes you to one of the best spots which is less crowded but the views are just as good where he provides you with teacoffee fresh fruit egg cooked from the steam of the volcano and banana sandwiches he positions you approximately m from a crater from a previous eruption which is quite concerning a first but less daunting when the sun begins to rise at this time you have cooled down from the climb and sat within the clouds and thus can become quite cold and would therefore recommend long pants and a jumper for when you get the topwhen the sun rises you get some amazing photo opportunities and a once in a lifetime experience the mountains lake batur low level clouds and orange landscape are breathtaking as the sun rises further and the area begins to warm this is when you get to see monkeys and bazir takes you to the best places on the summit for further photosthe descent is much easier and takes about an hour to get to the base where bazirs dad returns you back to your hotel note traffic is bad in seminyak so this journey was quite tiresome and took about  hours  minutesall this for  indonesian dollars gbp is completely worth it and you can sleep all afternoon by the pool anyway as you arrive back to seminyak at approximately amso i recommend do the tour use bazir phone number included and uses whatsapp take long pants and jumper for the summit try and get an early night the night before,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,if you choose to treckup in the morning for surrise it is worth it every bitword of caution unless you are used to trecking not advisable to the sunrise treck the darkness and the terrain makes it toughthere are motorbikes available on demand enroute if you cannot continuethe return treck is betterthe view from the top of a fuming hillmountain is simply breathtaking,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
1.0,we didnt take the sunrise trek so we somehow managed to miss the mafia in the morning  ish amthey managed to get us on the way back though we were shouted at and threatened he even suggested that we should go back to the top and spend the week there as a punishmentits an ok hike and lovely view but dont bother and dont give them your money there are families with children hiking this place we were two girls on our own and they were not ashamed to threaten us it was a bloke telling us that we made their sacred place dirty but he was happy to smoke aroundridiculous how they treat the only source of their income do not gowe managed to agree on a penalty of  per person because we were getting tired of the argument and it was about to rain but now i wish i had told him to bugger off and given him nothing,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
1.0,mount batur is a renowned hiking place and is popular for sunrise this is by far the biggest tourist trap and the price range for hiking is as low as   ruppiah to as high as   ruppiah depending on how would like to get cheated a local person briefed me about this tourist trap and how the mountain mafia doesnt allow the tourists to be on their own i enjoyed the views and the sunset from a distance,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,mount batur was on my to do list in bali and i managed to get it from our hotel paying only k i was first told k by a private driver then k from the same company our hotel had a good deal with them so it was not a bad pricethe driver was on time got there at  am and had a shady crepe with traces of banana and chocolate and some coffee then we were advertised the packed lunch on top of the mountaini must admit i am not the fittest person but this hike was damn hard  i am clumsy and trying not to slip on the rocks is a mission  thank god it didnt rain  since i was struggling a nice man was helping me to climb the steep rocks in the dark and i thought buying water from him would be enough to thank him he told me not to give him money in front of the guide and next thing i know he takes me on a slightly different route and find myself alone with him in the dark asking me for k for the waterhe tried to put the flashlight in my wallet and i end up giving him k and s my pants from that moment i decided i need to stay close to my group and avoid such expensive handsthe view is amazing getting on top of the mountain at  am after a crazy hike in the night  oh yeah the guide was totally useless is great we waited for the sunrise but due to cloudsnothing  a lady just said casually  we havent seen the sun in the past week  i guess they forgot to mention that when bookingtotally agree on the mafia comments it was a pretty cool experience after i recovered from the s my pants extra adrenaline and my group was a lot of fun on yeahthe packed lunch was  boiled egg with  slices of breadthank duck i was not hungry ,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,the view points offer great views of both the volcano and the lake there are several hawkers around selling souvenirs and clothes at really cheap prices,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,an early start am pick up but the views were worth it the guides are brilliant they are full of information about the area plus they get you up and down safely you will be picked up from your hotel in an air conditioned car and driven to the base for coffee and pancakes around am you will start the walk up the walk up isnt the hardest but the path has a lot of loose stones which do move when you stand on them so make sure you wear suitable shoes,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,our family of  did an exhilarating trek up mt batur to see the sunrise we woke up   am to drive  hrs to the bottom of the trek we started the trek  am  reached the summit  am well in time to see an awesome sunrise the trek itself is difficult  one has to be relatively physically fit to do it one needs good trekking shoes to climb there are a couple of spots to buys water or just rest a bitwe had a good guide wayan organised through bali golden tour our local tour operator our guide was good to take us to the best viewing points etc the  hr trek is worth it once you reach the summit to see an awesome sunrise amidst the scenic beauty,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,great and impressive view of the volcano with the volcano we went where based on the guides recommendation on a trip to ubud we arrived with a perfect sky free view and  minutes later the volcano was covered,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,we  girlfriends and i did the climbing in april we get up at am and started at  am in the midst of the night it was heavy stuff but some guides helped us it was really breathtaking the moment the sun came up at am and the moon still at the other side,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,beautiful views and locationwe couldnt do tracking due to leg problem but gorgeous area of into thatwe sat at top and was amazedonly downside like kuta beach you get swarmed by sellers which didnt take no for answer,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,you will ideally climb it to enjoy the sunrise depends from where you are starting but it should take you  to  hoursonce you reach the summit usually your guide will give you breakfast while waiting for the show to startif you intend to climb a few more volcanoes in indonesia this a good one to start in order to warm up for more serious stuff later ,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,we booked private tour with bazir it was worth itthe view is amazing we could see the moon on the other side as the sun rise and mt agung and rinjani are really really beautifulafter mt batur we went to the hot springs its not that hot though id say lukewarm springswill definitely be back,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,awesome views from viewing point and some restaurants you will be harrassed by local people selling their goods though  harrassed might be a mild word you can get bali souvenirs very cheaply here awesome place to visit a must see in bali,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,great if you have time to hike mountaint please visit mount batur at kintamani bali  this is an active volcanos in bali very very adrenaline fight,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,my partner and myself booked a private tour with bazir following reviews we had seen on trip advisor we paid  idr for the both of us bazirs father picked us up from our hotel bang on time at am we drove for around  hour to the meeting point bazir actually goes from a different point than the mainstream tours and it is so worth it to miss the crowds we are relatively fit  we made it up in just over an hour but bazir was more than happy to rest whenever we asked we arrived at the top at am and were one of the first there so had a really good spot  we were very fortunate and got to see an amazing sunrise we also saw mount agung have a small eruption on the way bazir and his mother cook breakfast at the top of the mountain along with coffeeteahot chocolate it is a proper family run tour  as  girls in mid s i can honestly say at no point did we feel unsafe  even when we were driving through what seemed to be a field with a very rough road in the pitch black if you want a proper individual tour i would strongly suggest contacting bazir  ,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,we booked the trek through our villa and i am glad we did talking to a few people at the top it sounded like they took the cheap option and that is exactly what they got our guide picked us up from the villa and then we drove to the base of the volcano it was early in the morning and was a little fresh so when they say to bring a jacket this is definitely a good idea for my partner and i who i would say are of average fitness this trek was quite easy we did notice that many groups were stopping along the way so they do allow for all fitness levels but we pretty much powered from the top to the bottom in around an hour it is dark so you do need a torch but the walk itself isnt too dangerous from what i understand it is packed year round so getting up the top first is your best bet for a good seat to experience the view again it is cold once you reach the top so that jacket comes in handy most tours offer some breakfast but dont expect anything too fancy as many people ended up with dry bread and a boiled egg when the sun rises it is worth the early morning start but if it wasnt a clear morning it wouldnt be as beautiful again the walk down is relatively easy but we took off before the crowd so you dont get stuck behind the slower people enjoy the additional experience of the monkeys that come out once the sun comes up and the dogs that walk along with you as you trek to the top,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,dont bother if not going to be a clear at the top got with a tour agency get picked up early am at hotel and drive to nearby mt batur and have breakfast and given water then drive on to the start point have to pay a little to use the gross toilets have a guide up the mountain who gives you a torch apparently this is low season but the path was packed beyond the point of enjoyment at times literally single file queue to the top takes about hrs up and the same back down the views are worth it and lovely to watch the sunrise also given egg on bread at the top then walk down and our particular tour went to coffee tasting and the rice terraces on the way back to ubud,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,fantastic scenery and serene atmospheregreat people and lots to see the weather changes very quickly as you ascend towards the mountain region and sudden rain showers can be expectedthere are lots of stalls on the street selling fruits and souvenirs as well as clothes and local attiregood experience overall,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,the driver was at our lobby  mins before schedule  we were staying in ubud only so we started at  am the driver was extremely courteous who drove us safelykeep some change handy using the bathroom costs  idr  you can rent a jacket for idr  incase you need refreshments there is a shop down where you can pick up stuff though while climbing you will have people selling stuff not sure how they are priced thoughi would say that certain level of fitness is necessary  if you are a first time trekker  good luck  it is steep towards the end of the trek and slippery because of the volcanic ash however now from the mid point they have a dirt bike service that can take you up to a certain point and gets you down  that comes at an additional chargeplease do not carry eatables if you are not okay with monkeys around you  one of the monkeys was eating into a pack of cigarettes also another monkey actually got onto a lady back and removed candies from her back packbut the view is breath taking and it is completely worth the trek also save yourself the trouble and do the trek with a group or a guide ,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,we didnt want to get up for the morning trek with kids so we visited from seminyak on a day trip the resturant was very nice and traditional indonesian with western options views of the volcano were great make sure you go before pm as the cloud sets in and hides the volcano,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,if you can handle the early morning and the physicality of climbing up and down then this is a must do when in balido your research and book with a good guide to avoid all the busy routes and crowds we organised via our hotel capella ubud and luxed our with the five star tour including a picnic at the top with breakfast and coffee we managed to avoid the main busy spots and had a private experiencepack good shoes and youll be hot when ascending cold at the top and sweaty on the way down and by the end youre drenchedthere is a new temple being built at the bottom that makes for some good photos too so dont miss that,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,lovely sight from kintamani a must visit climb up mt batur to see the sun rise behind mt agung well worth it,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,well organised trip up mount batur we were actually the only people on this trek and the only people walking up the mountain that evening which definitely improved the experience we are two relatively fit people and honestly found the trek quite hard work but our guide was very accommodating the email from the tour advised us we needed to wear long trousers but one of us got away unscathed wearing shorts i would recommend either hiking boots or trail running shoes it is very slippy in places especially coming downit was very warm ascending in the sun and then quite difficult to see the route with torches in the dark so the sunrise trek might make more sense if it wasnt for the am startits worth taking water but the driver does stop at supermarkets en route and bought us a couple of large bottles the guide made us banana sandwiches at the top of the mountain but luckily we had our own provisionswe went from sanur and it was a  hour drive each way so didnt get back until pm luckily there were still restaurants open in sanur when we got back i would recommend it but it was a difficult and tiring trek it felt dangerous in places coming down the guide had to help me we did get some amazing sunset photos though which made it all worthwhile can imagine it would have been disappointing if clouds spoilt the view however,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,this requires a lot of effort but you will be rewarded once you get to the top and see the views they are amazingreally early start is a must for this i wouldnt want to do it in the heat of daytime and sunrise is perfect when youre up therewe started trekking about am for the sunrise at am i would advise to come preparedbring plenty of water and some snacks as you will definitely need the energy also invest in a really good torchthe hike starts off with a a gradual incline towards the mountain in the pitch black the terrain here is comfortable but you have to wear walking boots or trainersfrom the base of the volcano it is an steep incline and the terrain from the base to the first platform is various different size rocks and it is really unsteady to walk on the climb is steep and is pretty difficult but if you go with a guide they are good with allowing you breaksthe view from the first platform is obviously amazing but you have to carry on the further walk approx mins to the very top platformbe warned this last bit is extremely difficult it is extremely steep and the terrain is very slippy and sandy but it is so worth it at the topwe made it with about  mins to spare so all in all it took us around hour  to get to the topthe walk down is challenging in a different way again the terrain is unsteady until you get to the road i would advise just taking it easy on the way downi am definitely not a regular joker or anything and even though i found parts challenging and difficult we completed the hike and i would definitely recommend doing this if you are in bali,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,we read some reviews on trip advisor and a number of people suggested bazir as a guide we contacted him via whatsapp    and he replied very quickly and was helpful over whatsapp on the morning of the climb he was there waiting for us right on time my girlfriend and i werent feeling  for the climb and bazir was patient when we needed breaks and we never felt rushed at the top he told us some history about the mountain and got us a seat breakfast and a hot drink ready for sunrise bazir was a great guide and although you may pay slightly more to have a private guide it was  worth it as he takes you a quieter route and is very accomadating,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
1.0,do not go if you want to go without a guide we a group of three wanted to go up mt batur we went there on our own and tried to go up the mountain however as soon as we tried we were blocked in doing so by  men surrounding us they said that we had to pay   for the guide  pp entrance we refused to pay for a guide and tried to go again on our own at which point one of us got tackled and the others got pushed by the men after that we went away but we were followed by the guys on their scooters every time we stopped they also stopped and threatened us not to go up on our own to conclude if you want to go up mt batur please inform yourself about the possibilities at a place you trust,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,he told us alot about the history of the mountains and had alot information some friends were a bit slower but bazir took great care of them,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
1.0,we went there with my husband this morning we arrived around am and decided to hike by ourselves as it is an easy trek as we were almost at the top of the volcano a guide with a motorbike asked us if we had a guide we answered no and told him that it is ok we do not need one he started to be very angry and aggressive then he jumped on his motorbike and rode on me and my husband trying to make us fall into the ravine after he stopped  meters away waiting for us and screaming so with my husband we decided to climb off road to be safe he waited min and as he did not see us he went back on his path and then stopped again waiting for us finally after  min he was still waiting for us we were sitting off road on the mountain waiting for him to leave as we were afraid and he started to threaten us he screamed twice you will die in the forest we finally found a group to go down of the mountain but their guide was laughing when we told him the story when we arrived in the forest we paid  guys to bring us back to our motorbike they were aggressive till we paid themso to conclude the mountain is nice but we had the worst experience ever we never faced this issue before in bali guides are useless as the treck is easy but they just want to take your money and if you resist they are very very aggressive,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,as with most if not all tours you leave your ubud accommodation at around am our driver was late but this seems to be a common occurrence and there is plenty of time to get to the mountain we had a stop off at a teacoffee house for complimentary tea and coffee and a cold banana pancake the stop seemed to serve little purpose and the toilets were local style remember to bring your own toilet tissue and hand sanitizer this is also important for the toilets at the base of the mountain after this stop we continued our journey arriving at the start and meeting our guides who were very pleasant and attentivethe trek itself is definitely not easy although this is subjective if the pace is fast it will seem like torture we had a guide at the front and rear of our party and quickly after the st kilometre the younger taller members of the group strode off with the lead guide the rear guide stayed with us the route is very steep in parts to the point of scrambling and there are a lot of loose rocks under foot the incline and pace can make for quite an unrelenting journey at least k of the ascent is on this loose ground and a reason why decent footwear should be worn i saw at least one hiker wearing shower shoes in fairness at the top but i wouldnt recommend this even people in running trainers struggled due to the small loose rockswe had no sunrise unfortunately due to the clouds not clearing but the view was nonetheless spectacularwalk down was tough as this was an equally relentless downhill slog again without proper shoes this would have been very tough on the feet and unpleasanttours from ubud are around  rupees pp we paid  ive seen some tours as high as  rupees pp im not what you get for this as everyone seems to be offering the same formatthis review is not about any single tour operator as the issues are specifically related to the location not the operators,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,have to admit i wasnt sure about how much i would like going to look at the volcano mt batur we didnt hike the volcano but were able to enjoy viewing from a restaurant with a beautiful view overlooking the lava field below mt batur there is a peaceful serenity surrounding the mountain along with some gorgeous scenery and i have to say it was a highlight of our morning oft times it good to go early so the view of the mountain isnt obscured by clouds or fog,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,batur trekking was the mostly planned and awaited program of our bali tourto our great delightthe weather was finewe were picked up from kuta at  am on th february and the trekking started around  amit was not as much difficult as expected but the final part was bit difficultbecause of some clouds we could not see the entire sun but the panorama and the photos that our guide took were breathtakingwe also saw the volcanic smokethe descent was way easierthough february is said to be rainy it did not rain at all in mount batur prepare yourself with good sports shoes and jersies batur trekking made our bali trip even more memorable and nostalgic absolutely recommend,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,it is a gorgeous mountain the views are very nice it is like h from ubud so not too bad also ask your driver to stop at a decent lunch place there are a few there that offer amazing views of the mountain it can be a romantic trip also the volcanic rock is fascinating,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,my experience at mount batur was great there was a beautiful sunrise not too many people and friendly guides the hike wasnt too hard and i enjoyed it we woke up at around  to  am and drove there with a trip agency i cant remember its name later we stopped at a hot spring wich was very relaxing the only reason i put a four star review is because the breakfast was not the best overall i recommend going to mount batur but bring your own food,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,we went to mount batur by lunch time so directly went to the restaurant amora where you get an excellent view of the volcano not only the volcano you can see the batur lake also from there from the roof top of the restaurant you can get a great view,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,this was the highlight of our trip to baliwe had wrestled with the cost and it did end up being fairly expensive even after negotiations in the end we did it all and were very happyfrom seminyak our driver was waiting in the lobby well before we arrived was very pleasant there were not demands for money etc he arrived at the start point in great time giving us plenty of information about what was happening local entrance tolls were paid from his pocket we climbed the mountain with the exceptionally patient bazir who then left us to enjoy our peaceful surrounds while ensuring breakfast was done the breakfast while simple was not stingy and the hot boiled eggs were gold and warm banana sandwiches a memorable touchafterward a wonderful sunrise and plenty of pictures and monkeys bazir explained the eruption history of the volcano and we returned to the waiting cari had arranged a package of hot springs and coffee plantation visit and our driver walked us through these paying the entry price hot springs end waiting patiently the hot warm springs was a nice recouperation after the climb and we had some lunch here although dont expect to muchthe coffee plantation was exceptional offering free samples of there many coffees and teas and a great education into the many plants they have and use on the property prices of anything you buy from the shop more than compensate for their time and efforts thoughfurther notes reviews are how these folks make their contacts so they are very keen for good reviews this keeps everyone honest and thats why ive left this reviewi contacted bazir directly on whatsapp on  and he responded very quicklyhe uses his dad as the driver so you know theres no miscommunication herebazir is not keen on adding extras to your package as he gets paid for guiding you up the mountain everything else is just to keep you happy so you can be assured hes not trying to package deal you into greater profitsthere are  hot springs sidebyside we went to the cheaper one your call,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,strongly recommend to get a guide for the trip we engaged balitrekkingtrips and have one of the best experiencefirst of all thank you driver adi for being on time and await us at the wee hours at am i have heard many tours which came late and such wasted the resting time of the trekkers so really appreciate that we were greeted on timesecondly we meet up with our guide mangku who was cool and steady once we intro ourselves we went straight to our trekking i guess mangkus thoughts was to go straight to the tip of the mountain to secure the best spots for us appreciate the thoughts throughout the trekking mangku was kind and often made sure that the pace for us was suitable his command of english was very good and i was deeply impressed we shared numerous stories throughout the trek and i must say it made us comfortable with him around best of all mangku takes really fantastic photos that you cannot find in anywhere else this is the first time we climb mt batur and we really enjoyed it we also heard there are alot of routes to the top of the mountain and this is why we look forward to climbing it,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,myself and  friends went to the mountain with a hired driver left at am to get there from seminyak and planned to hike without a guidewhen we arrived at the village road we got pulled over by security to pay a ticket entry which was  idr each which we had no idea about then when we arrived at the car park we tried to follow the path to the mountain with a group of other tourists but we got harassed every step of the way by several men asking who was our guide threatening us to go back to the office and pay ticket entry or they wont let us go furtherthey blocked our path and around  men aggresivly surrounded us shouting to go back until we submitted we haggled the price but still didnt have as much money as they asked due to the extra ticket fee before hand so they forced us into a car to go to an atm to get the money for them our driver advised us to go with them very scaryif you can get past these people its a very simple and easy hike up with no guide needed and bumper to bumper tourists but its not worth it for the aggregation and intimidation for what should be a nice morning out it made us all very upsetonce we paid up the guide who previously intimidated us was suddenly very relaxed and pleasant gave a good tour and showed us shortcuts up the hill took some good photos of us but had limited knowledge on the area just a few facts recited over and overthe views were amazing once the clouds cleared well worth the trip but just hire a tour guide and haggle the price not worth feeling scared for a view,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,this was one of the best experience i had in bali our driver came to fetch us at am it is a  hour journey to mt batur reached the destination at am a guide by the name of ketut was there to bring us up the mountainwe started our trek in the dark using torch lights beginning is easyhowever it is not an easy trek uploose rocks and steep ascend in sheer darkness are not exactly the best combo for a relaxing morning hikemy boyfriend was suffering quite a bit during the hike because hes overweight and not in the best physical condition so we had to take frequent breaksat last my boyfriend called me and the guide to go ahead firstwhen nearer to the top is much much tougher than the bottombig thanks to my guide ketut if not him pulling me up along i think i will be much slowerwe waited for my boyfriend to reach the top we were glad to be able to catch the sunrise togetherhowever quite disappointed as theres no breakfast for us just only hot chocolate drink being servedwas hungry when seeing other people eating bread with eggs and bananasthe view of this volcano was incredible definitely recommended one of the best activities ,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,as i have been saying in all my posts that bali was a total surprise completely different from what i have heard from people it is beyond beaches and pubsone such place i visited was kintamani volcano for people who want to explore and adventure early morning trekking could be another option which can be arranged locallythe view from the restaurants opposite to the volcano is mesmerising the restaurant serves vegetarian and non veg buffet for  rupiahfor those fearless people  there are couple of swings in the restaurant feel free to use them if you want some good pictures,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,early start and some hard stoney trails to navigate but well worth the journey fantastic views at daybreak a real bonding moment for family and friendsif youre worried about fitness levels take your time plenty of people going at an easy pace i bombed up with my son much to the guides chagrin but hey there are plenty of people ahead to follow you wont be aloneyoure more likely to die on the drive there if our driver was anything to go by,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,you need a low level of fitness to get up to the view of the whole country side you can walk the ridge of the volcano to see all the different perspectives it was amazing the warmth from the gases comes out in some small pockets our guide was good but you dont need one its super easy to find your way and they ask for exorbitant prices aud per person plus tips,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
3.0,our mt batur experience was victory saved from the jaws of defeat based on recommendations we went to mt batur as a day excursion from ubud this mountain is famous for its sunrises but our crew of five was never going to get up at am so we decided to go midday to get out of ubud and stretch our legs we traveled to mt batur with another family so together we were  people with kids ranging from  years to  years we learned upon arriving that we needed to hire a local guide to take us up the mountain we understand the full employment plan and were very willing to contribute to the local economy but they were asking for  per person for guiding services we werent going to pay  to walk up a small mountain so we proposed  for our whole group which seemed very reasonable we almost agreed to this price when a big thunder clap and dark clouds warned of an approaching storm so we decided to bag the mountain and just walk up the trail a ways however at this point the local guides got very aggressive and said they wouldnt allow us on any road or trail without a guide we explained there was no way we were going to pay  to walk a mile or two in the rain so continued on now they got downright hostile and started threatening us with their motorbikes and the police weve traveled for three months all over se asia and weve never been threatened and harassed like these people did further to have them do this in front of a group of children was awful unfortunately everyone was upset at this point so our peaceful mountain journey was already ruined we returned to our cars and had them drive a few km down the road to find a short trail we could walk on before returning to ubud it turns out the racket covers the whole valley but our trail head was so obscure that no other guides were there we trekked on a remote path for about a km and somehow found a newly paved asphalt road that leads to a pagoda near the top of the mountain this road shows up now on google maps  on the west side of the mt we followed the paved road to within  meters of the crater rim and then walked up the trail to the top we enjoyed some great views and the rain held off until our return journeywe enjoyed mount batur but the guide scam needs to be eradicated as our experience proved they dont respect their customers and this is all about extracting money from peoplefor those visiting bali who want to do the mt batur sunrise hike i support you buying a package deal that includes a guide the trail is moderately technical and doing it in the dark could be challenging especially in the crater but guides are not required if hiking during the day,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,we hired a tour to go to the mountain and it was expensive the only thing the tour does is picks you up they promise breakfast but it is a joke white bread and boiled eggs horrible you have to wear comfortable clothing to hike and climb and warm clothing because it is pretty cold on the mountain i would recommend taking water and some food and warm clothing tour starts early for no reason we had to stop for first breakfast which is completely unnecessary and then wait for sunrise  minutes you need to be a little bit in shape because the hike is long and you cannot hold your group members,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,weve seen so many sunsets in bali we knew we had to catch a good sunrise and what could be better than seeing the sun rise up from the mountains early in the morning a no brainer when we decided that it had to be mt batur we lived in seminyak a good  hours away from kintamani and we knew the climb was at least  hours fortunately we chanced on a super guide bazir  and we arranged everything via whatsapp from singapore on the dot his father picked us up at the hotel at am and we took the  hour drive to mt batur to meet bazir i should add that bazirs dad is himself a good guide for bali and he lives downtown so he can provide good reliable services if needed bazir was excellent he slowly coaxed me and my wife on the way up and i found it taxing with my heavy camera lenses and tripod were talking pitched darkness at am up a difficult mountain path and who says you dont need a guide having a private guide has tremendous benefits and he will stop when we do and help along the way with encouragement the last  mins to the summit was treacherous with sharp rocks and narrow climbs the beauty of the sunrise mt batur lake and abang made up for all the pain we experienced simply breathtaking we were too tired to eat all the breakfast bazir prepared for us other than a sandwich and coffee that was a nice touch coming down was another experience and bazir helped carry my heavy camera bag and tripod seeing that i was struggling i strongly endorse using bazir if you plan a sunrise trek hes thoughtful helpful and gave us a good tour guide description of the area eruptions foliage and history a good guide makes your journey worthwhile and memorable and well worth the special private support you receive,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,mount batur is an active volcano in northeastern bali and is a popular attraction there are plenty of lookouts in and around the town of kintamani and the views are spectacular on a clear day accommodation is readily available in the area to enhance your enjoyment there is significant volcanic history in this area with mounts agung and abang in close proximity with eruptions being prevalentvisit stay and enjoy ,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,i always think the best way to experience a place is through its sunrises and batur never fails you with stunning views whenever im in bali ill try to plan in a hike although it is getting more and more expensive to do the trip through tours and guide dont think they allow solo travel yet,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,its harsh and slippery so be careful its steep and full of people but its fun when we went there it was cloudy so no sun rise but coming down was worth it the views are beautiful,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,view of this volcano was awesome though we just drove past on the way to the hotspring we were informed it erupted way back in  so theres plenty of history in this area we were informed that a regular hike up the slopes would take around  hours perhaps an adventure for another time,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,i climbed mount batur with my family the scenery was incredible and i was very grateful the guide gave me the best service and my family i was very happy to meet a very friendly polite guide for my next visitcontact kris bali trekking again thank you for the good service during the climb,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,its pitch black youre surrounded by jungle and you can vaguely make out lights moving up the slope of an unseen giant mountain far far far above you if it wasnt for our guide im sure we would have got lost or lost the urge because this is a tough walk at freakin am but when you reach the top and the sun stares you right in the face and screams good morning it is worth the effort it truly isa few negative points there are trail bikes that can take you most of the way to the top they are a pain in the butt on the track destroy the serenity but im sure are a lifesaver for some people that are way out of their fitness depth they will cost you money and like all things price is negotiable we declined the idrk pricetag the othe rissue is the eggs and sandwiches at the top they are a waste of food we had no interest in eating after slogging it out up that hill but once at the top it is a magical sight take your time to explore and enjoy the view the walk down is a much easier proposition,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,whilst its been a long time since this volcano erupted you can still see the blackened areas  with nearby homes the view from the bridge is good  but like with most areas in bali every tourist spot is commercialised and everyone trying to sell you things,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,heyfirst thing id like to say is that if you want to do a special tour like their sunrise trek then having a guide is much more important that being said climbing the mountain in the middle of the day does not require a guide the locals are pretty much all in on a scam making up all sorts of reasons you need a guide but as you ask them questions you find out the only reason they say so is because they want to squeeze you ass for cash here are a few things to know about going guideless do it early in the morning when the path is lit yet the sun hasnt had enough time to brew rain like in the afternoon follow the path since s of people have made the way up super easy for a hiker with almost any experience dont listen to the locals unless if they bring their price down to reasonable numbers like a few dollars they dont really offer much in terms of safety or guidance paying them is more if youre into stories and giving them a livelihood donation i say donation because the people living near the volcano do just fine my biggest problem with the whole situation is that it comes off as a big scam that everyones in on they say its a matter of respect and conservation while they dont respect you enough to offer reasonable prices and dont keep the mountain clear of trash the mountain isnt super trashy which is why they could easily do a better job of it by offering an incentive like  off if you pick up a piece of trash along the way watch your step this is basically rule  with hikinghowever the context here is that rocks are a bit more sharp than usual since theyre volcanic this makes it easier to find solid footholds and more damaging for stumbles an extension of dont deviate from the path  dont go into the crater the volcano is technically active which having the guide doesnt really do anything extra for saftey other than keeping you away from obvious hazards like going into the crater where steam is released at certain spots this process of releasing pressure and heat is good for the volcano to stay chill but dont push your luck by jumping into a steam vent you dont need a guide to know that dont mess with the monkeys at the top too much theyre pretty entitled because everyone gives them food theyll basically ignore you but if you pull out any food they assume its for them dont let them push you around bring healthy snacks and avoid intimidating the males with prolonged eye contact and the mothers by getting near their babies bring a friend  this is pretty much rule  for hiking it makes the experience more fun and gives you an out if you trip and hurt yourselfthat pretty much does it for mount batur if you dont care about the sunrise experience rent a motorbike  head there earlyish in the morning the hike is pretty chill with stunning views and funny monkeys dont pay the locals a dime until they bring their prices down from outrageous to reasonable probably the worst part about the whole experience is how much of a hassle they can be about letting you go along your way,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,we climbed mount batur to see the sunrise and it was well worth the climb we started in darkness with lights attached to our heads and took about  hours to reach the top fantastic experience,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
1.0,wed heard so much about how great batur was so we were willing to do the am start the experience was a total let down though and we regretted goingissuesstart time after being picked up at am we stopped on the way to batur for breakfast which was a kind of crepe while being fed can be nice we all would have preferred an extra half hour of sleep over thisits not really a traditional hike getting to the top does require going vertical but it doesnt feel like a hike as you approach the mountains base you can see a steady stream of headlamps leading all the way to top the entire way up youre essentially in a line taking a step when the person in front of you does as well that being said part of the reason that its so slow is that tons of people come in totally inadequate clothing youre going over volcanic soil you need real shoesthe guide doesnt offer anything youre required to hire a guide to go up batur due to the above point the guide does play any role in navigating you up the mountain ours was actually out of shape and kept requesting breaks on the way up we didnt get any information about the mountain or its importance from our guide either on the way down which is a less intuitive path our guide actually ran ahead of us out of sightbreakfast on top of the mountain though youve already stopped for a  am crepe youre promised breakfast on top of the mountain too when we got to the top our guide instructed us to take a seat and said he would be back with our food  minutes later he returned with breakfast two untoasted pieces of white bread and a hard boiled egg from members of the group who had gone searching for him we learned that he and other guides had spent that time sitting in a shack with a heaterthere is no guarantee of a view this bit was expected no person controls the weather and higher altitudes are certainly subject to more cloud cover than the beaches the clouds did not break one bit for us but again we knew that was a possibility if we had understood the overall negatives of the tour as a whole we wouldnt have make the trip knowing that a sunrise was not for sureit is wayyyy overpriced not just overpriced by bali standards  usd would have been too much to pay for that experience in the usits hard to get the most out of the rest of the day we got back and were super tired from the early morning much of that day became a lost causepositive there are some monkeys that you can see on the way down,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,we booked the sunrise tour with a guide through a tour company the guide is a must the track is challenging and im glad we did it in the dark the views and sense of accomplishment once at the top was awesome we were a group of four of varied fitness and we all got to the top coming down the guide helped me down most of the way due to the slippery nature of the rocks and big steps combined with my fear of heights very glad we did this and would recommend to anyone,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,amazing view up there you should be with ok condition physically to do this hike but it so worth it trip starts about am at your hotel and you are back about am,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,mount batur is so beautiful even when its raining its still stunning this time we ventured down the bottom and you can see where the lava has been when the volcano erupted the soil at the bottom is so rich the age grows so many crops in ransom spots,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,kintamani is a village on the western edge of the caldera and a great place to see kintamani volcano and mount batur one of four volcanoes in bali,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0,if your goal is to see the sunrise and views at the top then pray for clear skies if you are up for a good early morning walk in the dark and later a downward climb then go for it christmas day  resulted in a great trek up and down but the sunrise photos are nonexistent great photos of my daughter and i huddling together to stay warm and dry no rain just heavy cloud and mist guides were brilliant and supportive for the not as capable trekkers on the tour monkeys were curious i am certain that when the weather is more generous mt batur views would be fantastic,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,climb a volcano was always on my bucket list and i think this one was a good choice hike wasnt really hard about  hours on the top you can see magnificent sunrise view i didnt like only the crowd on the final part i was before season on bali i cant imagine how many people hike batur during season highly recommend,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
4.0, an early morning hike in the dark is suggested for the sunrise views the best season to do the trek is from april  july avoid rainy season as trekking becomes difficult its a medium level hike moderately difficult can say and will take you nearly  to  hours to reach the top totally depends on your fitness level so take breaks to enjoy the hike wear comfortable workout clothesshorts proper hiking shoes are a must to avoid slipping where rocks and gravel are loose and do carry woollens and a headlamp also carry water and some snacks carrying camera is a must to capture the most spellbinding vistas but after clicking few shots relax and enjoy the magnificent views you can book the hike with the local company and it will include everything  pickup and drop off local guide up the mountain water flashlights and simple breakfast at the top generally group tours are conducted but you can also have private guide to hike at your own pace,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
2.0,we set off from ubud at am arrived at the base of mt batur at am and began the hour long hike up the volcano i have medium fitness level and had to stop every  mins or so to recover it was very challenging to the point that i actually had an eib episode exercise induced brinchospasm thank god my husband had his asthma puffer on him the guide said very little to encourage us up the mountain and didnt even come to check on me as i was having the asthma attack to see if i was ok we eventually made it to the top where it was freezing cold we were in shorts and tshirts and had to sit for an hour waiting for the sun to rise while sprukers tried to sell you a loan of a blanket for  rupiah we were not told to bring warm clothes unfortunately the sunrise was hidden by clouds on our trip and the  of us were desperate to get down the mountain out of the cold so we asked our guide to lead us down not long after the sunrise the guide held my hand the whole way down which was very helpful as the loose gravel is very slippery in fact everyone of us took a tumble on the way down ending up with scratches and scrapes as we had walked up in darkness with flashlights we had no idea where we had actually walked when the sun rose and we saw the trek we had just done we were pretty horrified at some points we were trekking right on the edge of the volcano and a slight stumble or wrong footing could have easily seen one of us fall over the edge i dont like being negative but i feel we were not adequately prepared for this trek in any way shape or form my husband is a very fit tradie and he did it no worries but for your average joe who walks a few times a week or bike rides this was a very challenging venture im glad i did it but i wouldnt do it again,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,loved our walk to the top of mt batur we hired a guide who escorted us to the top where we had fantastic views awesome to reach the summit of a volcano and see gases being emitted and some wild monkeys as well as a stray dog or two the walk was somewhat challenging but not too long just over  hours return,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,this was the first time id ever hiked up a mountain its was hard but so so worth it our local guides we had  because we were a group of   aged between    were amazing and caring i would not have made it up or down without their help  supportthe hike is steep rocky and hard going but the view at the top makes it all worthwhilewe did this for our daughters st birthday she wanted to see the sun up very memorable and totally worth the effort,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,the drive to kintamani where mount batur is located is very enjoyable and scenic the view of the mount batur will also depend on weather conditions at times if you are lucky you definitely will get one of the best view of the mountain along the lake it is worth every penny and time spent to reach the place,Mount Batur,Bali,Alam
5.0,this art museum in the center of ubud is a gem it is filled with important works by balinese artists that span many generations and traditional mediums the owner of the museum is often on site and available to converse about the mission of the museum he is a fine man genuine in his love for bali and the artists whose work he helps to promote and preserve one feels welcome protected and inspired all at once,Agung Rai Museum of Art (ARMA),Bali,Budaya
5.0,highly recommend a visit here as part of your ubud explorations we had a very relaxing morning browsing the artworks and beautiful gardens the artworks were absolutely incredible,Agung Rai Museum of Art (ARMA),Bali,Budaya
5.0,the perfect place to discover the balinese art and the gardens around are gorgeous a coffee or tea is included in the price,Agung Rai Museum of Art (ARMA),Bali,Budaya
5.0,the museum was next door to our hotel gorgeous grounds to wander around the art is beautiful too agung rai was sitting on a bench enjoying the day when we were there and graciously allowed us to take his picture with us he has done a lot to keep the culture and traditions of bali passed along to the younger generations,Agung Rai Museum of Art (ARMA),Bali,Budaya
4.0,the galleries themselves are nice if a tad limited in scope the gardens and grounds are a hive of activity children practicing balinese dance westerners learning traditional art craftsmen restoring stonework artists sketching all in all very pleasant to walk around for  minutes or so,Agung Rai Museum of Art (ARMA),Bali,Budaya
5.0,before you even get stuck into the art and digesting all of that this musuem is set within such a charming ubud oasis its worth going in just to wander around the grounds admire the buildings and enjoy the atmosphere its so peaceful and charming then you also have all of the wonderful art i really like the modern building most,Agung Rai Museum of Art (ARMA),Bali,Budaya
5.0,we attended a gamelan workshop visited the museum saw the children practicing dance and watched the sunday night legong performanceall was excellent and gave us a valuable insight into the rich balinese culturehighly recommend it,Agung Rai Museum of Art (ARMA),Bali,Budaya
4.0,unlike the other art museums in town which are thematically monotonous there is a richness of artwork here though the traditional pavilion suffers in the same way the modern building has a number of striking pieces that really grab your attention the grounds too have both interesting artifacts and some really pretty nature it is difficult and confusing to find your way around and it appears that they are trying to do too much and invest in too many projects the paintings are well marked but the site would profit from better outside signage and arrows,Agung Rai Museum of Art (ARMA),Bali,Budaya
5.0,the center of ubud has changed fortunately this gorgeous museum has notbeautiful buildings house numerous art works the peaceful gardens also contain a number of artworks there were resident artists working during my visit and young children participating in a dance classesa truly balinese experience away from the crowdsif you are traveling to ubud from the southi especially highly recommend,Agung Rai Museum of Art (ARMA),Bali,Budaya
4.0,the art museum has passionate guides dotted throughout the large cool display rooms who where only too happy to talk about the art works it was also pleasant wandering around the spacious gardensthe ticket price includes a hot or cold drink i enjoyed a refreshing iced tea and every one else enjoyed iced coffees service was very friendly and i made a mental note that the large cool open aired restaurant would be a good spot for a meal,Agung Rai Museum of Art (ARMA),Bali,Budaya
4.0,this art museum is good to understand a bit more indonesian art with some older art and a lot of modern art as well the visit of the arr buildings does not take long but you can also hang out in the park and you have a complimentary drink including in the price of the ticket i advise you to take this drink not at the main entrance coffee but the one at the other end you have to crosse the park bur just ask the staff they will tell you how to get there because the one of the main entrance is next to the road while the other one is next to rice fields so its more peaceful we did the visit end of afternoon so there was almost no one else there,Agung Rai Museum of Art (ARMA),Bali,Budaya
4.0,always well worth a visit if you are into balinese art and the cool peaceful atmosphere is a balm to the soulthe grounds are lovely as wella nice thing to do for an hour or so away from the busy streets of ubud,Agung Rai Museum of Art (ARMA),Bali,Budaya
5.0,art in ubud has had a remarkable flowering in the past  years thanks at least in part to expatriate artists like walter spies arie smit and paul husner for a fuller appreciation of evolving styles i recommend not only this collection but also the neka museum and the puri lukisan museum but if your time is limited to only one the agung rai collection has the best breadth from some precolonial panels to very contemporary works take your time to appreciate the rich detail characteristic of these paintingsthe grounds are beautiful there were artists at work when we visited along with a childrens dance class and the idr admission price includes not only an informative booklet but also a tea with a stick of cinnamon to stir it and at least when we visited a sweet potato and shredded coconut concoction wrapped in a banana leaf a treat landscaping of the resort is impressive and relaxing too a peaceful place to escape the unfortunately intense touristifcation that is destroying downtown ubud there are also evening dance performances,Agung Rai Museum of Art (ARMA),Bali,Budaya

4.0,the stepping stone pond area is very smallwe stopped by because i really wanted to see the pond with gold fish it is a very pretty place with a lot of water garden spots but the focus of many tourists are the stepping stone areas honestly the photos make it look bigger but it is actually very smallbe warned there are many tourists who are so obsessed with their instaworthy solo photos its crazy how illogical and rude some of them are they expect you to rush off so they can be with their friends and take photos or shoo you away while you are also taking a photo then you ask them to share the stepping stones and cross over  many cannotthe tourists think they are the only ones visiting there and allowed the picture perfect space are bali tourists just more rude because it is economical to visit so you get that type of touristsit is a nice place theres also a pool to cool off with change areas  access is included with the ticket  the pool is kinda greenish but i saw people swimming inthere is also another man made lake beside the stepping stone pond where people can take a little boat to float away troublesoverall it is an interesting complex thats a water park for people to literally try to cool off from the bali sunthe ornamental carvings are interesting once you get to finish taking your photos at the stepping stone pond where the kois are so fat looks bigger than a new born childi think spending   hours here to include people watching after the struggle to take a memorable photo,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,my wife and i visited tirta gangga as part of a day trip from ubud in which we snorkelled over the uss liberty wreck in tubullen and stopped by this temple on the way back others may visit it as part of a trip incorporating mount gunung agungthis was built by a rajah in  and has been described as a water park which i think is somewhat accurate two large pools greet you as you enter and these are filled with goldfish whom can be fed with food purchased at the entrance gate one pool features the famous concrete lillipads which people line up on for photos in front of the iconic  tiered fountain behind these pools are two smaller swimming pools which feature clean flowing water on top of a black volcanic soil my biggest regret is that i didnt bring my swimmers to go in thisthis is temple is fairly popular given its grandeur but due to its distance away from ubud not as overrun as for example tirta empul its large size also distributes people well so you have your own space and are free to exploreentrance fee was k for memory i believe it is a little extra if you want to swim in the pools i think  hour of time here would be plenty,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
3.0,its a very small area it is a very nice place but people were everywhere so you couldnt take good photos and had to be careful not to bump into other people on the pathways the area where you had to step on stones in the water to find your own spot to feed the koi was crazy people fighting for a spot before you could get there you could walk around the area in less than  minutes not a place to go to relax and enjoy the surroundings,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya

5.0,beautiful manicured gardens and the splendor of enormous fish ponds adorned with overfed fish this is truly a beautiful setting unfortunately overrun by selfie and instagram show offs making it somewhat unbearable for anyone wanting to enjoy this beautiful site the actual stepping stones on the pond are actually far smaller than imagined from photos but the temples and fishponds are extensivethis attraction is best done from ubud as its east bali with narrow slow roads making getting there a long journey i left ubud early in the morning with my fabulous informative driver from ubudareatourscom as a solo tourist its important for me having an english speaking registered guideclose to this attraction you could also cover the palace grounds virgin beach waterfalls and back to ubud via candidasa a full day excursionbest to get to tirtagangga as early as possible before the crowds converge onto the site and instagrammed to the max making life somewhat miserable for everyone else,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya

5.0,visited as part of an organised tour so had limited time here the place is small but was quite crowded when we were there there is a pond full of koi and fish food is available to purchase from one of the stalls outside there is also a pond you can walk on via stepping stones unfortunately there were some people who were intent on doing a full photo shoot without a care for anyone else thus holding up all the other visitors we were informed that there is also some cottages in the grounds which are available for rent entrance fee is nominal and there are free toilets inside the grounds if you have the time this place is well worth a visit,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,one of our day trips to this beautiful place lovely gardens to walk around with family or as a couplea lot of history in the place and you would need a good couple of hours to go round the gardens there is a restaurant on the premises and not badly priced and good food take a bottle of cold water with you as it does get hot walking around would i go back yes and i would recommend it,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya

4.0,beautiful temple it is i loved it buy fish food for  idr from outside shops and while youve found the perfect spot for pictures sprinkle some fish food to attract the fishes for even better pictures but i noticed the pond who has the stepping stones had fishes who werent much hungry when i sprinkled food in the other pond the fishes were fighting for food they were so hungry yes do take great pictures but be thoughtful for the other ponds and their fishes too who might not make u great pics nonetheless theyre gods creatures and deserve love  dont ignore them fish food is very cheap  enterance ticket was  idr  but try going early morning to avoid the crowds when the tour busses have arrived the fight for pix and spots becomes crazy also enjoy the swings there,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,after a disappointing visit to lempuyang we arrived here to heal our wound entrance fee was  rupiah what did we expect we did not do much homework before visiting bali we left it to our local balinese guide robert  to do everything for us he of course did a great job we will engage his service again in next visit this temple was probably my favorite simply because it was so tranquil and yet filled with dynamism of the kois in the pool this was the main attraction and they mattered a lot they were beautiful and wanted human contact well one reason was because of food i did not try if they would give us a kiss i believe they would they swam close to you  believing that you wouldnt harm them they let you touch them and wow they were huge i strongly recommend this place it gave you a totally different feeling as compared to other temples in bali both water and kois here combined to exert a good flow of chi or energy here you felt like recharged here do not miss this place ,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,do in conjunction with ujung water palace nearby beautiful temple in magnificent surroundingscan see volcano in distance,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
4.0,very busy especially with large tour groups so there was a bit of a wait to get onto the stepping stones or to get an uncluttered picture still worth a visit,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,i really miss the good ol days of travel when you could visit a site and share it with few other travelers now there are disrespectful tourists crowding every site tirta ganga is a beautiful garden with predominate water features one fish pond with stepping stones to walk in the pond its so crowded with instagram snappers that its difficult to enjoy the tranquil beauty of the place its worth a visit  idr but the crowds destroy the ambiance my  star rating is for the garden itself  star for the ambience,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,one of the best place not to be missed when visiting bali the beautiful lakes with lots of fishes in it made the place even more interesting good place to take snap shots especially in the lake,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,very beautiful place that was calming and peaceful recommend to go before  am since the place can get quite crowded with all the instagramers who only use the grounds for their own photo shoot theres a lot to walk around and appreciate the scenery and you could expect to spend up to  hour there,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
4.0,nice but crowdy place i expected to have more fish in the picture but they are rather scarce in different cornersgo there early in the morning if you want good pictures,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,mind blowing place of course you have to be amongst the first ones to arrive otherwise the whole experience is going to be ruined by hundreds of tourists we arrived around  and it was a convenient time to take some solo pictures and have a pleasant walk around entrance fee k person and there is no dress code,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,beautiful surroundings and a lot of historywe took a guided tour of the  main locations in the area each had its own merits but every one of them shared the beautiful views and architectureour local guide was very knowledgeable about the places we visited definitely a thumbs upwe stayed at the hotel inside tirtagangga which allowed us to visit the park after and before opening hours which was great during the day tirtagangga itself was very crowded with people lining up to take pictures and selfies at specific spots,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,this is one of the most pretty temples in east bali about  hrs drive from ubud and about the same from kuta depending on traffic it has been a about  years since i last visited tirta gangga and since then it has become very popular with the rise if the instagram generation therefore i suggest getting their earlier to avoid the crowds and the heat as it can be quite hot there as there is little shade its really good fun stepping through the pools and watching the koi we went around pm and as you can see it was very busy next time will go there earlier,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
3.0,the approach is lined with tourist stalls selling the usual tat but worst of all is the stall with fruit bats bearded dragons and snakes for the tourists to touch and wear for the all important photo horriblethe actual grounds and layout of these water gardens are beautiful but marred by what seems to be very common those purely there to pose for their selfie photos everywhere you go there are scantily clad women posing and poutingperhaps im showing my age but i wouldnt recommend this site there are others which are no overrun in such a manner,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
4.0,you should probably come very early in the morning i was here around  and it was already full of tourists entrance is k and for k you get  bags of fish food must do,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
4.0,beautiful place great architecture and the swim was amazing we swam in the pools which was super refreshing lily pads were to packed to get a picture but,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,this is a must see when visiting bali it is the most beautiful place ive ever seen its lush you feel transported back to an ancient time wear your swimsuit and take a towel you can swim in  of the pools dont miss the chance to swim in a kings pool there are several places to stop sit and enjoy the scenery you can buy fish food before you enter take your camera amazing photographs come from this place it took about  minutes from seminyak to get there by car we hired a driver each day traffic in bali is chaotic,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,as i stated it is a beautiful place to visit on the east bali regionas its the favorite place to visit always crowded but the place is huge dont just take pictures on the pond explore it until the temple behindactually you can also swim there its really nice experiencethe best time is in the morning where not so many tourists on siteyou can also buy some fish food in the stalls along the entrance so you can attract them when you want to make a nice pict on the pond,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
3.0,very crowded especially the first part where you have the stalls to walk above the water and the fish when you go at the end of the temple its better with less people the temple itself is ok could be more taken care of but ive seen more beautiful ones like taman ujung not so for is way more relaxing tirta gangga is lacking authenticity because of the crowd of selfieslovers,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
4.0,this is a very picturesque and tranquil spot it was relaxing to walk around and see the water features the statues and the ornamental fish we had a push chair and it required a little lifting and some areas were a bit tricky but overall it didnt impede on our enjoyment of the sitethere were quite a few other tourists here but everyone seemed to be quite quiet and respectful no bus loads of tourists that i could seerecommended if you like taking photos and seeing some balinese history,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
4.0,a  hour drive from ubud too much traffic so better go early in the morning best combined with a visit in pura lempuyang since its very close,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
4.0,the kings palace is just gorgeous nice to look at and feed the fish some of which are huge highy recommend going early to avoid crowds of instagrammers,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
4.0,my boyfriend and i went on a monday around am and there were tourists there but it was not overly crowded at all its good to come here before midday before it gets busier if youre staying in kuta or around that area tirta gangga is around a  hour drive but its worth it this place is historic and has quite the view if you wanna to learn more about the history of this place come with a guide you can feed the koi fish  there are stalls where you pay for the entrance fee that sell fish food entrance fee was  rupiah while we were there there was some construction going on but that didnt really matter great place for photos and great place if you wanna get away from the more busier tourist attractions,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
1.0,i went back to tirta ganga after many years and was appalled to see the level of tourism promoted there of course people will come in the masses if its not protected and im wondering what the longtime keepers of the this land are thinking there were lines of people waiting at the koi pond to have a selfie made while stepping on the intentionally placed stones there were boat tours for the kiddies hamburger stands restaurants ice cream parlors popcornthis used to be a serene complex now it is grand central stationim sad to say i dont recommend this site anymore its way too disappointing,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,brilliant and simple constructiona giant football field like area with no of water pools with koi and other fishes resorts are available inside it with private pools very neat and plenty to capture in camera,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,tirta ganga is a lovely water palace i have visited many timesthis was the first time i didnt enjoy it with instagrammers taking ages to get the perfect shot and preventing others from moving freely aroundim no longer going to wait patiently while you spend minutes posing and pouting enjoy the view,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
4.0,a beautiful place to visit yes there were lots of tourists it was busy but it did not detract from the good calm energy of this place we spend a couple of hours here and it was just lovelythe market however that they make you walk through as you get out is not nice at all and the only place in bali were they were aggressive even grabbed my wrist as i walked through asking me to buy their items such a contrast to the peacefulness of the temple,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
4.0,we stopped at tirta gangga on our way back from lempyang temple and were glad we had a halttheres a water pond one can walk on through the steps and click some wonderful pictures while those colorful fishes swim bytheres a separate pool to swim for a priceexpect to spend anywhere from  minutes when here,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
4.0,tirta gangga literally means water from the ganges and it is a site of some reverence for the hindu balinese strictly the name refers to the water palace built in  by the raja of karangasem anak agung agung anglurah ketut karangasem it is however the name widely used to refer to the general area which includes the water palace and the lush rural areas around tirta gangga water palace is a maze of pools and fountains surrounded by a lush garden and stone carvings and statues the one hectare complex was built in  by the late king of karangsem but was destroyed almost entirely by the eruption of nearby mount agung in  it has been lovingly rebuilt and restored and has an air of authentic royal magnificencethe centrepiece of the palace is an eleven tiered fountain and there are many beautiful carvings and statues adorning the gardens the area around tirta gangga is noted for its rice paddy terracesaround this place also have some hotel home stay and restauranttirta gangga is only  minutes from lempuyang temple nearly  hours from denpasarso if you come to bali you have to see the culture traditions religion country side of balihave good holiday,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya

5.0,so apparently this was the kings playground for his children to play inthese gardens were very prettyeasily spend an hour walking aroundgood fun feeding all them hungry fish too,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
4.0,the main attraction are the stepping stones in one pond there is only one way in and out and people line up to walk through it once you are in you are really stick until you get to the end we spent  to  minutes walking the short path because people stop to take photos at least  different spots and some people really take their time or have large groups where everyone gets their own time in front of the camera there looked to be a swimming area behind a fence so there may have been a hotel in the area but i am not sure,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
4.0,we stopped off here between the gates of heaven and lunch at bali asli a smallish area home to several ornamental pools stocked with whopping fish that you can feed with the food on sale from the shops at the gatesshame about the new cafes selling burgers in the place one of the pools has a stepping stone route along it you cant really pass anyone stood on the stones so the whole line of people traffic will move as fast as the slowest instagram obsessed visitor taking the th shot of the same thing because the composition wasnt perfect thats fine but it can cause the walk on the stones to take an hourthere are swimming pools there which all use the same water as the fish pools the water looks crystal clear and there are changing rooms if you want to have a dip we didnt the pools are split for boys only and familyfemale there is a hotel attached to the attraction you will need some cash to get in i think about  each and the fish food is  for  bags,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,after being disappointed by the fake gates of heaven tirta gangga was a great relief during that trip and it is such a beautifully built and designed water palace with lakes full of fish everywhere which you can feed the atmosphere of the water is so relaxing and calming,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
1.0,i have been to tirta gangga three times in the past ten years before it was one of the most beautiful gardens in bali the trip i took in june  however i found it drastically changed with concrete restaurants built and under construction inside the botanical gardensit appears that they have decided to make it a place for children with boats you can rent to ride around the ponds and ugly metal swingsthis used to be a spiritual palace complex quiet and peaceful now it is simply a tourist trap overrun overcommercialized even selling hamburgers which is against the hindu culture sadthis is truly a tragedy,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,this is one of the most photographed and shared places in bali so its definitely worth a visit you can spend there at least  hours and keep discovering beautiful things and viewpoints come with your camera battery fully charged,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,lovely little spot good day trip or if your going past stop in fish food gets cheaper as you get closer to the entranceit only costs about  per person to enter and its worth it,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,you can squeeze visising tirta gangga in as well as the gates of heaven in one day i prefer the tirta gannga water temple so much more than the gates of heaven it is worth buying fish food when entering to feed all the giant koi fish inside tirta gangga has nice shaded areas to sit down and enjoy the sights if wanting the take photos on stepping stones in the pond be prepared to line up,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,this temple is quite different to others and is very goodthe water features are incredible and the fish feeding is very entertaining,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya

5.0,my wife and i stopped by tirta after a visit to lempuyang and must say we wished we would have gone here first the lush gardens were simply stunning the ponds and fountains with large koi fish made for a great photo op and the pool which is open to the public would have been a great refreshment from the midday heat top  temples we saw on our trip,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,this is such a beautiful location get there early in the morning and buy some fish food before you enter we got some great photos on the stepping stones,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,great package east bali tourlempuyang templetirta gangga water palaceblue lagoon snorklingmongkey bar,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,we came here around noon and the place was crowded like everyone is pro model or photographer you have to wait to step in the pool with koi fishesplace really beautiful made for enjoyment if you pay additional fee you can even swim in pool inside if it wasnt so crowded i could stay for hours relaxingfeed the fishes make some pictures in water surrounded by koi fishesa must see,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,this beautiful water temple features a couple serene koi ponds that you can walk through there is a small entrance fee of  idr and it opens at am located on the eastern portion of the island we decided to visit this temple along with lempunyang and the ujung water palace all three are within  minutes of each other roughly so it was pretty convenient to hop from one to the next we got to tirta gangga at  and pretty much had the place to ourselves for about  minutes it seems most of the early birds arrive around am i definitely fell in love with this place and loved feeding the koi there was just something a little magical about this temple,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,though the place is very scenicit is full of crowd for that instagram shot and you need to wait till your turn comes the mazed pools are very beautiful and you can see those colorful fishes through the waters early visit is suggested for less crowds,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
3.0,another place in bali that has been pretty well ruined by instagram it used to be so tranquil and relaxing now the pond area near the entrance is awash with crowds trying to get photos of themselves standing on the stepping stones yuck the rest of the grounds are very nice and less crowded and i guess if you went early morning or late afternoon open  to  daily you wouldnt have to compete with the hordes,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,tirta gangga is a former royal palace karangasem in the past which is also called the holy water park with beautiful fish which is located in bali indonesia which is in the east and close to the great volcano,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
4.0,its an almost two hours trip from sanur areaour visit was at the beginning of june so it was not very crowded when we arrivedtake some time to feed the fishes in the pool its worth to visit the place especially if its your first time in balithere are many spots where you can take great photos and the view is very nice,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
4.0,as in many of the temples here in bali people flock to take pictures and forget these are holy sites in this case the site is very beautiful and its a shame that most people treat it like visiting a garden and not a shrine they feed the fish and all get in line on the pond and it doesnt feel sacred any more,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,a picture perfect picture taking place the view is stunning so if youre into instagram moments this is the place for you,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
5.0,i have been anticipating this trip and i wasnt disappointed others may not like it but i liked it the most i get to feed the kois on the stepping stones all i did in the trip was walk along the way the stepping stones and after that left it was actually short unless you want to stay in the middle feeding kois as for the crowd maybe we were lucky there are not much crowd that we were able to take photos without photobomber on the background,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
2.0,not much to see besides koi ponds its a hour trip from kuta and generally a pit stop before lempuyang temple  gate of heaven,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
3.0,this place got crazy popular because of all the influencer photos on the gram great for tourism but bad for tourists i have not seen this much tourists packed in one place aside from lempuyang luhur thats a different horror story altogetherforgot how much the entrance fee is probably around  idrthe palace isnt really palatial in scale its smaller than i expected with three mediumsized poolsit would have been a pleasant experience overall because the place is pretty and cool but the other tourists were so rude i mean yeah were all lined up for that one shot with the koi fish and the pretty fountains and the pretty temple tower but is it really so hard to be patient kind respectful and not be racist for  minutesagain please treat others the way you want to be treated its that simple if you want to be treated like trash then you have a problemwe seriously had more fun at the ujung water palace which is bigger and more beautiful,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
4.0,a different kind of water palace lots of pools and fishes great restaurant inside the complex albeit a little expensive lilly and lotus pads were nice,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
4.0,a nice water palace tourists like to use the stepping stones but beware once your on them and theres a queue then youll be in the middle of the water for a long long time and not be able to get off practice standing on the spot for minutes at a time before visitingsome nice photo opportunities here too,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya

5.0,since we came from lempuyang when we arrived here its really crowded but still we were able to take nice photos you just need to bring a lot of patienceit was like a maze the stepsstones are not so big so you need to wait until the person you are following finishedbut there are other areas you can take picture so roam around,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya

4.0,we had a nice and relaxing visit to the water palace it was good that our driverguide decided to bring us there right after lempuyang temple we were tired queuing for almost three hours and he brought us here to have lunch we ate in the restaurant inside the water palace and the food was really good we were seated in the corner where we could do people watching while waiting for our food it was a good view from the restaurant because you can plan where you would want to walk first then take your photos or maybe you just simply want to sit and relax there are many corners in the palace to take good photos and if you feel like dipping in the bathing pool you can also do so i recommend seeing this place and try the only restaurant inside the palace,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya

5.0,we visited tirta gangga which are a wonderful water gardens that are well worth a visit but go early as its a popular tourist area and get very busy perfect photos will be difficult to get without the images being packed with tourists,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
4.0,the grounds of the water palace is stunning the main attraction is a beautiful pond with stepping stones and huge koi fishfish feed is available for around k idrmanoeuvering the stepping stones can be tricky especially if the place is busy so once you start the stepping stone queue be prepared to only get off at the last stone,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
4.0,while a tad busy during my visit i was certainly able to see the tranquility and peacefulness surrounding this beautiful indonesian landmark guests can walk the water trail and capture some cool pics of their friends walking on the piersbeams while they capture some cool pics of you doing the same if you choose you can also sit on one of the benches along the wellmanicured lawn and take in a breeze or two one thing to note is that the restooms need a little work but overall a pleasant visit,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya

3.0,im glad i went here as it is a really pretty place and it was a nice place for some photos but really it was only good for about half an hour there literally wasnt anything else to do there apart from look at the the water fountain walk across the stepping stones and look at the koi i also assumed it would be much bigger but it literally is what you can see in peoples photosthere is a nice bar on a balcony where you can sit with a bin tang and have a look at people nearly falling in the water trying to get the most risky photos its also a pretty view from up thereall in all im glad i went but i would probably be annoyed if i had travelled far to get there as you really could spend more than an hour or two there the fees for entry are pretty reasonable if you want to buy fish food definitely buy it before you get in from one of the street vendors,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya
4.0,absolutely beautiful water garden made evn more interesting with a stepping stone path through the water huge carp everywhere huge crowds as well but then this seems to bee the norm in bali you are never alone,Tirta Angga,Bali,Budaya

5.0,we took a private driver travelling from kuta to uluwatu stopping on the way for other attractions but the main attraction was the beautiful uluwatu temple the most compelling part of the temple complex however comes from its nightly kecak and fire dance performances which adapts the famous ramayana hindu epic and plays out against a gorgeous balinese sunset male sure to go early to get a seat in front and not facing the sunyoull be asked to wear a sash around your waist in any case and a sarong too if your clothes are too short the entry is around usd and the dance is about usd it is truly an experience and highly recommended,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya

5.0,i was at uluwatu temple  years ago as an excursion off a cruise ship so by the time i got there which was designed to be at sunset i was wiped from the drive the streets are narrow they are overcrowded and it felt like forever getting there and then that last haul back to the ship in the darkso this timewe went as part of a time killer on our last day in bali and not as part of a sunset viewing it was such a nice drive as  in daylight we could see thingsso briefly almost every block in bali has some form of temple whether it is a large one at the coast or a local park or even in the middle of nowhere across the road from berawa beach in canggu or even in someones front yard i am not belittling their religious beliefs i am saying unless you are a professor or a student of history  or theology and you are sort of doing a pilgrimage of religion  just relax they are almost all the same and the beauty in seeing them is nit the structure or the meaning it is where they are placed i have viewed and reviewed tanah lot temple its location across the water with celebrations in the water were spectacularwell its the same story with uluwatu its strategic position on the southwest coast is really an excuse to go to their and see the viewslast time the southern trail was overrun with monkeys this year  that section was quiet it was only pm no crowds but on the south side there is a pool with a ton of monkeys playing and the views of those cliffs are spectacularsince we were there last the bathroom facilities have been expanded and cleaned up the temple like  or  others i have seen are all closed except for worshippersi am still glad i went back,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya

4.0,uluwatu temple is a balinese hindu sea temple located at the southernmost point of bali locally known as pura luhur uluwatu it was our st destination in the tour itinerary luhur means something of divine origin ulu means lands endtoptip while watu is rock so basically it is a holy site built on the tip of a rockthis temple is one of balis  key directional temples meaning it is one of the  main temples of the balinese hindu it is also one of the most spectacular temple to stand on top of a steep cliff  metres above sea level facing the indian oceanno one really knows how old the temple is but it is considered to be built in the th century due to several archaeological megalithic rocks found around the temple locals believe that a javanese monk attained oneness with the deities  was struck by lightning  then vanishedunfortunately for us we did not get to enter the temple we were not aware that we could enter the temple our tour guide only showed us the amazing cliff views for those who would like to enter it is advised to go in the morning as it is less crowded there is also a huge statue facing the indian ocean most probably it is the representation of that javanese monkthe temple is open from  am   pm however the best time to visit the temple is just before the sunset thereafter you can also watch a kecak  fire dance performance at a nearby outdoor amphitheatre ticket is priced at idr it is by far the best place to watch a kecak  fire dance performance as you will be able to see the beautiful sunset in the backgroundplease dress modestly as you are visiting a temple nevertheless upon purchasing the entrance ticket you will be given a sarong or sash to tie around your waista small forest surrounds the temple  locals believe the forest monkeys to be the guardians of the temple the monkeys are known to be mischievous  our tour agent had told us to be careful with our belongings since the monkeys have perfected the art of stealing  barter trading however we did not get to see many of them in action only a few  they werent very active most probably it was due to the scorching heatin short the temple is famous for its beautiful cliff view  amazing sunset do not expect more than that however the balinese architecture  ancient scriptures also add to the temples appeal,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya
5.0,beautiful views and sunset we bought tickets to the kecak fire dance as well the dance is slow starting but once it does get going its most entertaining this show is in demand and we were advised to get our tickets before pm  we did we sat opposite the sea and got beautiful shots of the sunset as well,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya

4.0,the cliff itself was amazing beautiful to watch the sunset scene some walking paths are collapsing due to erosionsuggestions based on our experience  watch out for the monkeys my prada sunglasses and my partners sunglasses were snatched by them at the same time they were very sneaky and looking for every opportunity to steal never underestimate them i was fully aware that the monkeys steal but he got mine from behind we got them back in exchange for fruits but mine was damaged alreadysecondly if you are going with taxi there is no return taxi if you come back in the evening even if you get one the price will be more than  times than normal fare its rip off trap we tried to get a grab taxi but driver sent a bit suspicious texts like cant come to your location you need to walk m make sure nobody is following you etc so we ended up hiring very expensive on the way back our suggestion is you organise a tour guide or private tour ensuring you will go home saferemember bali is fun but full scams and rip off city will not comeback,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya

4.0,not a bad venue but go either very early  to avoid all the school buses or very lateto catch sunset the temple faces due west so with a bit of awkward twisting you should be able to get the ideal selfie for social mediathat being saidas far as all the other temples go in bali this temple made the hit list because of the position on a cliff top the temple site itself is closed for tourists as it is an active place of worship and it misses a great deal of art and design that makes bali so uniqueagain noteits far away from everything else i mean really far  and with traffic in bali what was meant to be a quick  minute drive turned into a journey into the mountains this is one place you dont want to hike  bike or bus too grab a driver for the day and make you way there are lots of hills lots of traffic zero too no traffic rules or enforcement and pretty much everyone drives per their own impression of what the rule of law might beback to the templedress code modest your entrance fee will also include a sarong that will need to be returned after the visitfrom the entrance gate its an easy down hill walk but coming back if you are not active pace yourself the incline can take the wind out of you,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya
4.0,the views were good we saw some beautiful cliffs the sea with its mesmerising colours a nice hike around the hills if only the weather was less scorching cheeky monkeys and just loads of peoplehowever when we got back to the carpark again i was left asking the guide why do they call this attraction the uluwatu templewhen the guide told us we were going to the uluwatu temple i was looking forward to learning about culture observing some prayer ceremonies and learning about the worshippers beliefs etc however there was none of that nonworshippers were not allowed into the temple and we only got to see part of it from afar i felt misled at the end of the visitto be fair it was still a pleasant visit i enjoyed the hike along the walking paths and snapping pictures along the way just think that they might want to give a more appropriate name to the place to manage expectations,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya
3.0,from internet and tv i expect much more to see than thisticket  rupper person and include the sarongthe view is great but the templewhere is really the templethe photos are from drones and you try to find the templealso be careful with your personal belongs stolen my hat there,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya
2.0,we did this as part of a free tour offered by the hotel we did this in low season when we arrived there were another  buses there  cars and  mopeds you get the picture you have to wear a purple sarong the monkeys can be very aggressive beware of loose articles like phones and sun glasses the temple borders sheer cliffs so you get a good viewing point but there is no photogenic spot for a sunrise with the temple in the background and it was hot no air when you leave everyone leaves bali traffic jam took us  minutes to do  milesthere must be better places research tanah lot,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya
4.0,we got exactly the photos and views that we wanted from this beautiful templehowevermake sure that you book a car both there and back we took a blue bird taxi there without any problems but getting back to the hotel was another storyafter the fire show no taxis available in the area we managed to get a grab but had to walk  minutes on an unlit road with traffic in the dark to get to the grab,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya

1.0,first i want to say that i love the kecak dance saw it in ubud and decided to see it again in uluatu temple at sunset besides the wonderful setup of this show and the high level of the dancer the show is disappointing for the following reasons they let in people far beyond the capacity of this place which i estimate around  people they let in people after the show has beguneven  minuets after as people continue to come they seat people on the stage and they almost touch the players bases on the previous note only a small portion of the stage is left to the players now the worst of all towards the end of the show just before the fire dance which is the climax of the showas the main actor is supposingly in a state of a trance they start to play jocks in the most childish stupid way including reaching some people from the audience and get them on stage to do some funny acts this is not what the play is suppose to be it is a very cultural act driving the players to a state of trance not in this show it was rediculos to the point that i was ashamed for them to see what they are doing to their culture as people are not prepared to this show they start to leave in the middle since there is not enough space to walk through they are stuck in front of you for a long time this is far worse than disturbing,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya

5.0,pura uluwatu tourist destinations that have their own charm  located in an altitude area makes this place has a natural beauty  the sunrise and sunset you can see in this place,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya
4.0,the temple is in such an idyllic location go for a stroll along the cliff wall looking over the ocean or watch the nightly dancing get there before  in high season,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya
5.0,that temple have a very special view standing m above the sea level it allows you to look at the ocean below directly worth a visit,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya
5.0,very worth the visit beautiful views and scenery with views over the sea monkeys were great to see and nice walk which wasnt too long,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya
5.0,uluwatu temple south of kuta a large complex that has stone steps walkways around the cliffs with great ocean and cliff views there are many monkeys around the parking area take photos from a distance entry fee is  rp,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya
5.0,astonishing beauty of sea shore temple and cliffbest to visit in evening for the sun setbe aware the uluwatu monkeys are very aggressive i lost my sunglasses at uluwatu when i was posing to camera,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya
4.0,nice view its not huge though and we can enter the temple area only the surrounding area but still worth going when you are around,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya
5.0,after visiting benova beach nusa dua beach and water blow we went to uluwatu cliff temple i think it is about  meters higher than the beach you have to park the vehicles and walk and climb the steps to reach the temple very beautiful surrounding and very crowded toohowever there are monkeys so you must be careful since they might drag your camera sunglasses etc a must visit place if you are in bali,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya
4.0,visited as part of a tour in beautiful surrounds but would have liked to have more chance to walk through the temple grounds dance was absolutely packed with people on the ground in the central arena part dance was really entertaining but the grounds of people took a little of the shine away,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya
5.0,the beautiful cliffs are really amazing especially during sunset a temple sits on top of the hills wherein you can watch the hour traditional kecak dance at pm one can continue to gaze at the sunset inside the area where the dance takes placehowever you need to secure your tickets at the entrance of the temple at least half an hour before the start of the dance because they run out so fast and find a good seat beforehand since the place gets cramped already by  pm get there early or when the place is already opened we got there  minutes before  pm and the whole place was almost fullin addition to this when you have ample time to walk around and along the cliffs you can do so provided that you secure all your belongings from aggressive monkeys darting from post to post on the cliff fences they are really aggressive that whatever they see such as hats eyeglasses sunglasses purses cameras slippers even while you are wearing them or maybe because they were yellow like that of bananas small bags especially cellphones youd have to bid goodbye to these things as you may not see them anymore you may take it back but they can bite or attack you,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya
4.0, years since we visited uluwatu and much has changed in the interim i guess its progress to cater for the hordes of tourists now visiting understandable that so many want to make the trek to the temple located spectacularly on the edge of the cliff overlooking the sea some m below we did not enter the temple too many people already there and yet more waiting impatiently great views  some great photos adjacent the parking areas you will find various outlets with some fairly pricey merchandise by bali standards i think that i prefer my memories of  and the kecak dance performed with a much smaller audience of worshippers and tourists attending and commencing just after we had witnessed a spectacular sunset,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya
5.0,uluwatu temple is a misnomer for a tourist in my opinion its a perfect spot to watch a awe inspiring sunset couple it with kecak dance performance and youd get mesmerized with baligo to the top of the temple till you see exit sign also it gets cold after sunset so dress your toddlers accordinglythe kecask dance has unreserved seatingthe app based taxis might not pick you from the temple so better to take a round trip from your hoteltheres no cafe inside the temple there are few shops at the entrance but they sell overpriced carry your food and waterthere are toilets available insidemy overall rating ,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya
5.0,arranged with mr gusti bawana for a tour to nyang nyang beach and uluwatu temple our drive and tour guide bagus putra is very nice very friendly with good and safe driving skills we enjoyed our tour because putra knew the places well and we didnt need to worry and just very relaxed the monkey in uluwatu snatched my wifes glasses unexpectedly but putra got it back for her thank you putra we definitely will arrange another tour with mr gusti when we return to bali,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya
5.0,nice view overlooking the ocean it gets super crowded in the evening as many gather to watch the sunset and a famous dance called god and fire we went for the view before sunset in jimbaran beach,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya
5.0,when in uluwatu you have to go the temple itself is not special or anything but the location is  come at  and enjoy the kecak dance and a beautiful sunset seated high upon a rock overlooking the sea,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya
5.0,once inside you will have stunning views of the cliffs and lots of fun watching the monkeys trying to harass the visitors,Uluwatu Temple,Bali,Budaya
3.0,i expected a bit more than we have seen some places of the park are not yet finished the main huge statue is really stunning but there are no many other things to see dancing show was nice but all in all it was not much worth to visit i think on bali there are better places,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,i spotted this in the distance when we landed its a terrific site but is not finished and no one advise that you can only visit the base of this monument ill go back when completed in the future,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,great photo ops great to learn about culture specially for my teen age children lots of walking water readily available for purchase there is a shuttle for those who have trouble walking that takes to main statue for extra costi would definitely recommend a visit to this,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,we went to gwk for the first time in  and thought it was just wonderful now in  it is almost complete and boy was it fabulous we decided to go up into the huge statue the  rupah each we paid was worth every bit we paid you cannot take pictures your belongings,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,it started with a high price to get in then being told after we paid that there was no transport to take us up the top for another  hours so we had to drag our  children our youngest only  and  and walk up to the top to visit the statues then further up to get to the big,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,it is a place where you pay then find out once you have paid you have to pay another entrance fee and pay again its a complete scam to get money off you  just look from a distance and save your money,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,we cant take pictures from the top observatory due to no camera policy no package ticket at the entrance to approach the statue,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,approachin denpasar bali from the west side i knew that because on a previous cruise i knew where the port was in relation to the island my first view was the cliffs of ulawatu on the right that meant i was on the south side of the plane i thought as we approached the threshold that there was a fire in the distance  as i kept seeing through the haze some billowing looking column that seemed to change as we approached  landed  and actually walked off the planeon the drive to ubudi asked the fellow nyoman the driver from bali airoirt transfer  whom i had booked way back from montreal  what the smoke like thing was he informed me of this new sculpture which took  years to get completed which was on a hill in the new cultural park its well known as gwk or garuda their airline kencana wisnu a huge sculpture even more prominent as it is mounted on top of a building and on a hill my travels in ubud brought me one day to tanah lot the great water side temple on the west side slightly north of canggu to sanur beach on the east side where one can take a boat to nusa ppenida islands and then back again to berawa beach in canggu at la brisa i mention these three places because bali is sort of shaped like an stretched hourglass with the tiny part south of the airport  being jimbaran such that on every point on a beach north one can see this monstrous sculpture with the planes landing and taking off just in front of it so on my last day in bali i rehired this great driver who asked a previous night if i would call him because business had really slowed down due to the lack of asians  mostly because of the corona virus you wouldnt know that things were quiet just from the number of cars scooters and delays in travelling on our adventure to revisit ulawatu in the south west i kept my eye open for this sculpture and he asked do you want to go to gwk i said absolutely as it seemed to be haunting me since day any way approaching it and seeing it from the road one could understand whay it took  years besideds politics it is huge the approach is beautiful a shuttle bus takes you up to the ticket office and then you can walk the spread out grounds or take a golf cart shtlle  up to the base in the bali temperature of   spend the money it is very impressive to see and the monstrous cutou towering square blocks of rocks you pass on the way up make you thinkyou are approaching something like possibly stonehenge or the ppyramidsmy title above denotes a bit of disappointment that is because arriving at pm and paying for a ticket does not give you access to beyond the first floor of the buikding so you miss the high altitude photo of the entire bali region furthermore on walking through the main level there are depictions of what this is supposed to look like except for the fact that they must be at least  years behind what their proposlas are no waterpark acording to the diagram no water pools no grand courtyard in front center as depicted in fact  other than the building and the sculpture nothing else is startedbut it is worth going to because this sculpture is so prominent and the highes item in balithat you see it from all over and it sort of gave closure to my departing the island,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,so sad  we arrived with our driver and quickly were told to go back and pay for parking our driver was leaving a separate entrance fee we were willing to pay however telling the driver to pay for a drop off was unacceptable,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,enjoyed our time here lots of different points of interest the park is a work in progress you can easily spend half a day here you can go up into the statue for an extra charge but you have to leave phone in locker  so we have it a miss however we had a great rime you can pay to get a golf buggy up and down to the statue there are places to get food as well,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,the concept drawings look extremely impressive but for now they are still building out the park the statue is worth a quick visit,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,the statue was majestic the shows were amazing i think you need to experience the cultural park at least once i wont come back though unless theres something new,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,this was amazing to visit given that it took nearly  years to complete we paid the fee to enter and walk to the statue that was our choice we didnt get to do the tour as we had just missed the next set time but we saw enough information on how it all began and what is yet to come of the sitesome people focus on the costs to visit without thinking of the effort and the cost that went into creating this monument we felt that its well worth the money and we look forward to seeing the end result one day in the future,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,fourth tallest statue in the worldhighest hindu statue in the worldhighest statue in indonesiaas much as the hype is for this statue there are other statues and gardens in this place if you happen to go to this cultural park be ready to spend at least half a day or even full day to do justice to your ticket price the have an array of performances going on hourly which comes at no additional cost its going to be quite a steep walk but they do also have buggy services at additional costone things that is strange is that there is no much space in front of the main statue  garuda wishnu to take a proper photo however it looks different in aerial mapdesign compared in real there is no straight entranceleading directly to the main statue probably its part of the design and not accomplished yet so that is a bit of disappointment if you would like to get a good photo of the statue with yourself it is somewhere after you come down after plaza garuda on your left there are few tiny entrances and that is where the right spot isyou can go up to the main statue but you cant get a good photo unless you have some wide lens camera or drone they also do have a lot of commercial properties inside such as dining souvenir shop and etc you can probably spend a whole day or at least half a day there,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,too expensive for what you get and far away from seminyak cost  k plus shuttlebus  k and when you come to the statue you have to pay another  k to go up in the building a few statues to look at nothing else nice view from the restaurant though,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,wasnt going to go here after reading mixed reviews but glad i went on regard to pricing and hidden fees i paid  for my entry ticket and was asked at the ticket booth if i wanted to pay for a ride to the statue you have the option to walk this is  so  altogether at the statue you can then pay to do a tour i didnt choose to do this so cant comment the statue is very grand if you paid for the ride you are then taken to the entrance of the main park which has more statues ponds temples for you to walk around at leisure there is a theatre type place showing traditional balinese dancing at various times which i enjoyed watching food court starbucks a buffet restaurant cafe plenty of places to eat and toilets for  you can spent a couple hours  half day there i think it was worth it,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,these parks are very well maintained though like every place in bali has an entrance fee but thats worth the prize,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,this is a amazing place and very well maintained the property is well spread out and the statues are masterpeices,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,very cool statue in indonesian country the best art in bali i like this monument in indonesia and very recommended this place,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,this is worth a visit if only to admire the engineering feat that went into building the main statue take the lift to the rd floor inside the statue for the view but also the facts and figures on the buildtip  go late in the afternoon and stay for dinner at the restaurant that overlooks the island book a table on the balcony for the best view towards the airport and kuta the view is a winner but the food is a very close second and surprisingly reasonably priced the view in any other part of the world would double the price of the food but not in bali,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,a very elegant place because there are many trees and also towering stones highly recommended for a vacation here,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,this is a sad sellout of the hindu beliefs how can you sell your gods to a jakarta shopping magnate this is purely money making at its worst its expensive and disappointingthe statue is impressive but the tour is a ripoff their is nothing to see on the tour your taken up in a lift to a corridor with descriptions of the build on plaques which could have been issued as a pamphlet at the entrance and a few peepholes to view bali they try to make out its a religious thing its sad hopefully the gods will intervene and stop this rort,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,garuda wisnu kencana is a god from the hindu religion this statue was made in  until  im very recommended this place for the weekend vacation,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,this was our second time here because the previous time the lift inside the statue was not finished so we came today in the bucketing rain decided to pay extra to get the shuttle up the hill instead of walking like last time so idr each to get to statue and then  idr to go up the lift but you cannot take any camera or camera phone up the lift all must be put in a locker and you must wait for tour times every half hour not really worth it,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,this would have to be the worst rip off of any tourist trap in any county ive ever visited  to start you enter through the car parking area at the bottom of the hill  to enter the park which is a very large disused quarry with open grassed areas then you get on a bus to take you to an area with shops and restaurants unless you want a  minute walk up a very steep hill in the heatthey then charge another  to take you up the hill in a small electric cart this take you to a large square at the base of the statue at this stage im thinking this is impressive the entrance is up the steps in a large bare hall lined with pictures of politicians to very end where they charge you another  for the tourafter waiting half an hour the been asked to wait another half hour we started the tour firstly hand over phones cameras ect put them in a locker then put on shoe covers  up we go to the ninth floorthe lift opens out on to a narrow corridor with pictures on the walls of concept plans of the statueand the final design more pictures of politicians the guide explains the story of the three gods and then tells us the whole complex is privately owned by an indonesian shopping centre and apartment developer apart from two dustbin sized peep holes that was itup we go to the  floorsame crap two peep holes along a corridor  no viewing area  that was the tour once outside we decided weve had enough of this rubbish time to get the hell out of here easier said than done the cart driver wont take you back to where he picked you up he drops you at the othe side of the fing quarry  min walk in the heat so you have to past all the shop stalls and overpriced food and drink shopscouldnt wait to to get away from the place dont expect to get away with anything under  by the time you allow for driver entrance fees drinks more drinks light lunch valium so to finish my rantdont waste youre time money energy or sanitylove bali and its people much better places to visit than this hell hole,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,you can see the statue from all over bali the grounds and set up were all nice and the cultural dancing was impressive overall the experience felt like a money draining exercise with a hefty entrance fee followed by more fees for a shuttle service followed by more fees to enter the statue maybe ok at sunset or if youve run out of things to do and see but there are plenty of natural places and historical places to see in bali,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,i knew i had to go here after seeing the structure from the airport when i landed i was impressed by how massive the gwk statue is even when not completed yet seeing the statue up close is amazing the balinese performers traditional parade and kecak dance at  pm really made my visit even more exciting i am happy i visited this place,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,walked around the grounds that was ok the site is still being developed found some of the staff very helpful while others were vague just watching the day go by there does not seem to be a leadership that promotes a culture at this work place that wants to attract tourism the food at the dining was priced ok and was presented ok but the service was slow we did not go in the lift to the top because not only was it expensive but the staff confiscate all cameras and phones before guests enter the lift because the operators own the copy rights to any pictures taken from the tower i agree with the reviews that refer to this attraction being over rated a lot of walking poorly sign posted maps not accurate and of course the obligatory street stalls on the way out  over priced they get the difference between height and tall mixed up at  meters it is not all that high compared to brazils christ the redeemer at  meters some in india and himalayas are also very high enjoy from a distance eg airport or kuta beach,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,the price that you have to pay is not worth it we were recommended by our driver just to kill time before our flight back expensive ticket for a short visit,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,my daughter and i went here early around am perfect time for photos there were only a few people there and the car park was empty when we arrived but full when we left around am the statues are amazing and the park itself has large monolith type limestone cliffsthe gift shop is good too free shuttle bus to and from car park and free golf buggy to take you to main garuda statue,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,bad service at the first counter we needed information about some staff that we thought we could see inside but the lady was arrogant and didnt want to help us it really seemed exciting before entering insidethe prices they set for sightseeing are way high and basing on the prices you may think you going to get satisfied with something youll really about to see insidethey take the phones away for not taking pictures inside the statue hence its only history about how the statue came to exist nothing more than that is insideand then outside the place is very huge and theres nothing exciting to see  hopefully in the coming years they plan something more interesting around this place itll be amazing if the prices they charge are really worth every thing to see,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,we popped in for a quick visit as part of a journey to another destination it was easy to park there are regular transfer buses from the car park to the main entry and the whole ticket buying process as easyit wasnt expensive to get in and we opted for the buggy ride up to the monument itself at the top of a good hill and to walk back down through the rest of the park wear trainersrunners not thongsflip flops also there are quite a few steps in some of the other monuments and templesonce you are up at the monument you have the option to buy a ticket to up inside it but we didnt walking through the park there are also a number of spectacular smaller statues and temples great view points good photo ops as well as shops and restaurants you could easily spend a few hours in the parkit was well worth the visit even if only to know you have been to see it when you spot the statue from everywhere else on the island,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,you should expect nothing special it is a very spacious area with very large statutes the most fun elements were the traditional performances they do in the park and to visit the temple area which includes a nice overview on the island of bali it is also under construction still,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,we just drove there without any previous online bookings after buying tickets then youre asked if you want a shuttle so pay more off we go to the top theres a vast concrete area with no shade or landscaping and its very hot we walked inside the hall  what a disappointment a few photos and very poorly decorated it could be so much better with history art not a boring large hall theres another ride to the second story which leaves at set times another rp but its just looking out of small windows and there are no cameras or handbags etc allowed why no cameras its the very reason you would go up higher to take photos of the view we left got the shuttle which takes you half way or another  to go to the bottom the attraction is poorly presented and the extra costs are incredibly annoying surely this can all be sorted at the entrance and choices made which package to buy without finding out along the way we were disappointed we could not walk right around the statue as the back entrance is blocked off sort out the fee into packages at the beginning  landscape around the statue make the hall an informative place allow cameras on the higher floors and get better organised,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,a total scam they charge u  different places  of us was a total of  idr the park in front is just a plan look like a worksite on the way up,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,we been there for the biggest firework for nye how the promotion promised everywhere it was very poor you must line up very long for drinks and beforemidnight was soll out to view the firework from the partyspot was not possibleso all togethe never never again better on the beach next time,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,i wasnt a big fan of this place i must admit very over priced and so busy if you dont opted to take a private buggyapprox  aus per couple return you would have a long up hill walk to do take in consideration the heat  humidity then once you reach the statue there is another fee to go up to the top approx  aus per person and at selected times so plan your visit well to minimize waiting timesi wouldnt rush backsafe travels ,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,flying into denpasar you can see this massive statue perched high on a hill so we were proper interested in going to see itit took a solid hour to get here from our villa in sanur and it was packedfirst you have to pay  ir approx aud to gain access to the status fine but they only shuttle you half way to the statue from here you need to pay an additional  ir per person to get a shuttle bus to the top of the statue and i tell you what on a  degree day you aint gonna walk it so you pay the money and go up to the statuewell its hugeso then you go into the building that the statue is on top of and we were all excited to get to know more about the statue only to find out that you need to pay and additional ir to go into the museumits literally a money spinner and i know people will pay it but its not worth it dont bother  honestlyoh and the staff have no idea what they are doing they do not tell you its extra to get on the shuttle so you have line up again to pay for the shuttle and then they put you under a gazebo which is like a sauna to wait for the shuttle which is a shonky golf cart which only carries  people at a timeyeah everyone dont bother,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,it was a good experiencethe status is sooooo huge not like the picturesu gotta visitand again everyone is so friendlyall bali people are so friendly,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,unless you have some spiritual or cultural connection with this place dont bother no one know what theyre doing the staff are no help at all and appear to not care to get a simple complimentary drink was like panning for gold in alaska in the winter you pay to get in you pay for a shuttle but only to the monument and half way down not all the way down to go just a few steps to get our complimentary drink we were directed around another monument in the rain when we were just a few meters away its a minus score from me,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,it is so big we could see it from the plane as we flew into bali look for the big black thing its actually green with gold black from a distance after asking a taxi driver what it was we rode bikes there for the day after parking a free shuttle bus takes you to the entrance once in we paid for our tickets to go to the ground level of monumentstatue and  more for a buggy ride there you can walk but its dry and hot and some uphill we were so glad we paid for the buggy there after watching others struggle in the heat cant remember how many but there are many statues in the cultural park which you are free to walk around and take photos we paid about k rupiah each for the tour so we could go up the top to the shoulders and take a look via an elevator this is optional only just completed last year its new and different however we only needed a couple of hours there and we were content,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,went here with my big family during year end season which makes it very crowded fortunately tickets purchase did not take a long time maybe many of the tourists purchase the tickets online the staffs at the ticket counter are very helpful the entrance ticket is only to enter the park if one wants to take the shuttle to the statue additional payment of idr kpax is required which makes sense since the park is fully owned  organized by private company the statue indoor area is closed by  pm  the shuttle going back lasted until pm the staffs inside the statue are also very helpful  informative there were  elderlies in our group  the park provide shuttle back to the ticket counter for elderly only   companion overall we had a good time there,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,landing or taking off at bali airport you cannot miss the huge statue to the south a continuation of a development long in the process but now upgraded a must to all visitors,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,unorganised chaos the place is in absolute shambles with bus loads of people turning up to see the grounds youd think thered be more than a couple golf buggies to take them to the attraction when you purchase a shuttle ticket dont expect to be taken to an exit thats an extra feethe best part of the experience was the gelato stand,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,we enjoyed our visit to park suggest you take shuttle to the top its quite a hike in the heat better to do in morning before it gets too hot and so you have plenty of time to visit all sections and see the performances at the amphitheater at there set times we sat right up the top in middle section and had a fantastic view and a breeze that kept us from overheating,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,visited the cultural park to see the impressive mtr statue and was very impressed by the enormous structures the people of bali have producedit really is a serious structure  mtrs in height and some mtrs widethere were other structures there that were also very impressiveas the park is reasonably new there will no doubt be countless other items added to the park in future yearswell done ,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0, pay to park wait in queue to catch the shuttle to ticket counter as no cars are allowed pay to catch buggy to the top pay to just enter the park and no mention whatsoever about having to pay more money on top of the entrance fee to go inside until you try enter you are then forced to wait until the next tour cannot go up in the lift without waiting for next tour your sneaky cons for more money did not get us we walked away  left the park others should do the same sheer greed plus we didnt want to wait another hour for the next tour with all the queuing we had already done pay for buggy halfway down then you are forced to walk the rest of the way through and past all the tourist shops wait for bus to go to car parkthis park is not run with any professionalism or the paying customer in mind its all totally about the quick buck they can get for every step you takethe heat up there is oppressive and there is no shelter from the heat until you are forced through the gift shop halfway down there are a lot of steps to see things and a lot of walking updown steep inclinesi became unwell on the day we were there with a bout of bali belly on and i nearly fainted from the heat on top of it they would not allow me to catch  pay for a buggy to go from the mid way to the bottom my partner ended up having to be very rm with them about how unwell i was and asked that they bring an ambulance which was parked there  was also a buggy and to that they said we need managers approvalthis is an absolute disgrace and shame on this establishment that you give zero attention or regard to someones healths needs there was no way i was able to walk any further without collapsing as i nearly fainted earlier your staff did not act on anything and had a total lack of compassion rst aid training is needed and to be understood by allworst tourist attraction we have been to in baliuse your hardearned money and go elsewhere wish we had read trip advisor before we went especially as so many people are saying the same thing and now i know its real as unfortunately we too experienced it,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya

4.0,we went to see and climb up to the rd floor inside the statue to see a commanding view of the island including the airport the windows are relatively large portholes at about the level of wisnus shouldersno cameras are allowed and all are asked to cover their shoes in disposable mittens to avoid scratching some transparent glass floors from where you can see some of the steel frames belowthe statue is the worlds most complicated and the third highest and a comparison in found along the tour which are done in small groups every half hour until  pm they have age guidelines for the tour from  yrs old because the tour is mainly about the structure and construction of the statue and that there are a few glass floors on the edges of the corridors on the rd floor i personally did not find them distracting or uncomfortablethere are discounts offered for seniors  and upa large water park with many other attractions are being plannedbut as it currently stands it is definitely worth a visit for the whole family,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya

3.0,as first timers to bali we were keen on visiting the park after seeing the enourmous statue after reading the review however we decided to see visit the park and decide upon arrivalwe were taken to the carpark which has a shuttle service to the entrance of the park it is a frequent service that lasts a few minutes at the entrance there were large groups of school students and already we were doubting our intentions to going in among the crowd as we approached the ticket counter we were told that the ticket allows us into the park which have about  areas of interest including two statues that were previously there there is an addiotional cost for a shuttle that can take us to the garuda statue but it is a oneway service only on top of this if you are interested in getting up into the statue it would be an additional cost all up it wouldve been over aud for a persongiven the crowd and the scorching heat in a place with very little shade or trees we decided it wasnt for usalthough it wouldve been good to see the statue and other attractions the cost of ticket is really offputting,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,what a waste of time in beautiful bali seriously i could not have been more disappointed upon entering we were prompted to pay for the combination package which included transportation to and from the main statue the attendant was extremely rude when i was in the process of purchasing tickets for the group it took three times for the machine to finally work and we received our tickets however when i returned home to my surprise i was charged three times i purchased a combination ticket which included transportation to and from the statue while waiting for our time slot we were free to roam around theres not much to see once our scheduled time to tour the main statue was approaching our group had split up into two separate groups after much argument and showing proof of purchase of the transport service several times one group was successful in getting into the shuttle the other group despite showing our receipts were made to purchase a separate transportation fee once our group was finished viewing the statue and waiting in line to take the transport back the transport stopped halfway back to the entrance and prompted everyone to get off and walk the remainder when i finally left i thought my nightmare of an experience was over however i was wrong the nightmare continues as i must now dispute being charged three times for this awful experience the staff here is terribly disorganized and the customer service is seriously lacking if you want to see the statue get a postcard this place is not worth the time and money,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,this is one of the biggest wastes of time and money we spent on one of our day trips you would be just as well finding a good spot outside to take photos as there is really nothing inside the park to see the cost to get into the park is around  we are a  k for an adult and this is very oddly determined by height so we had to pay full price for our  yr old that entry price wouldnt be so bad if that included everything but they then want you to pay for the shuttle bus up to the statue so we walked and had a look at the  other smaller statues on the way there is quite a nice vantage point to look back out up towards kuta once you make it up to the huge statue there is a bit of information inside but then if you want to go up inside the statue they make you pay and take a tour we said we didnt want the tour can you just go inside but no so we walked all the way back down again the whole experience took about an hour and that is because we walked up and there was a huge outdoor function on taking up a large part of the park and it was so badly sign posted that we couldnt find out how to get around it and up to the statue there seems to be huge plans for the park in the future but for the moment i wouldnt waste your money,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,entrance ticket price is rp  per pax and you should go inside by shuttle to entrance gate rp  per pax still have additional price if you wanna go to upstair museum by lift you need to pay extra rp  per pax the total cost only different rp  than borobudur which is much more worthed because unesco site,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,honestly theres some pretty views but most of bali is pretty views there isnt a whole lot here the place is huge and the giant statue is super impressive but its essentially all there is thereworth popping into if youre in the area or on your way to somewhere else but i wouldnt go out of my way to go back here againit was a bit disappointing,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya

5.0,definitely the best place to visit in bali the sculptures are just impressive and magnificent we were in love with all that we see around  recommendedis a little bit more expensive that other attractions in bali but is what you should expect for the quality of service that you receive and the absolutely amazing art work around around  rp per person i just love this place,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,i visited this place on my first day in bali the gardens itself and surroundings are nice and is a great opportunity to take photos you can pay to take a tour inside the actual status but all youre provided with is information on the history of the construction of the statue this was very disappointing i would not recommend paying for the tour,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,it is the largest monument in bali and you can see it on the horizon when you are landing at the airport there are shuttle buses that you up the hill to the main entrance where you purchase tickets pay an extra fee for a new exhibit for viewing the homes of different indonesian ethnic groups well worth the costs bring an umbrella for sure as it is very hot and not much shades the place is not fully built according to the grand design plan not worth paying extra to go up to the monument,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,for me the most impressive thing about the muchpictured sunset at tanah lot was a tiny dot on the horizon  miles away to the south whats that i asked my guide wisnu he answered the exciting thing about the statue of vishnu astride garuda from the moment you spot it as far away as possible is to keep your eye on it as you approach it to watch it grow in detail and magnificence as you get nearer and finally to feel its overpowering presence when you stand on the plaza and it towers over you it is an awesome monument made even more so if you keep in mind how ancient this god is and how much devotion he clearly inspires in his people what i learned from this first trip to bali is that the island is full of gigantic statues to the gods and heroes of the hindu pantheon you meet one at nearly every intersection but none is so grand as this vishnu and garuda at gwk yes the place is unfinished but i think that people who visit gwk when all of its amusements and facilities will have been done and vishnu and garuda are no longer lording it over their lonely hill those people will have a less compelling experience see it now well worth your time your money your sweat little man,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya

1.0,in general bali has been a nice island but this place is really brings most disappointing and fake bali experience everything is added money entrance buggy transfer statue tour and worst cant even bring camera up to the statue it also feels like a open quarry pit with unfinished building feature yet the visitor is overcharged do not bring your family here to spoil your bali experience,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya

1.0,we were bought us here by our bali driver after having lunch from jimbaran saying this has the statue which could be seen from above when flying without having any idea we just agreed to go that statue kind of depicts some hindu god which we got no idea lot of indian tourists were there and only few from other countries could be seen we didnt go to the top as its very tiresome lot of walkingour ticket included a free juice which is somewhat ok this park is of not some historical importance just some new man made structures,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,k to park k to get in k for the shuttle to the top k to go up the statue they just keep asking for your cash and the entire place is far from finished the photos on the website are renderings of what it might look like when its done right now it looks like a quarry surrounded by rubbish with a giant statute in the middle  totally misleading every step of the way  worst place ive visited in bali would not recommend,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,the place itself is not yet finished being built the images you find online or on their brochures are just renderings of what it will look like when its finished but its far from finished it costs k to get in for an adult and then its extra k each for shuttle to the statue and then if you want to go up the statue its k each everything costs extra and not much is worth seeing once its finished being built im sure it will be much better but for now give it a miss,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya

1.0,flying into bali it is hard to miss the massvie garuda wisnu kencana statue what a cool experience to go inside so we went the taxi drops you off at a parking lot where you board a trolly like bus to the entrance at any other attraction when you buy a ticket to a land markstatuetower that means you get to go inside and up itnot here nor is that fact listed on the sales window  idr  buys access past the front gate and that is it want to see the statue you can walk up a rough dirt road up massive hill with no handicap access in the bali sun with no shade or pay another  idr  for a rough ride in a golf cart to the top when you get closer you see the statue is massive but it also has massive straight line welds  which makes it look much less impressive up close walking into the statue you notice there is no air conditioning we presented our tickets only to be told your ticket is for the entrace only to go up you can only go during the scheduled times that were not posted anywhere except inside the statue and pay another  idr  in addition you are not allowed to bring cameras or your purse or anything electronic up to the top to take photos drones are also banned so to recap what should have been clear at the entrance of  idr   idr   idr   idr per person we had enough and wanted to go back to the bottom the driver of the golf cart brought us half way down and asked us to exit to see the rest of the park  as in walk around in the hot sun and look at the rocks we declined and asked to go to the end he drove us down and we exited the park when we tried to use our  free drink tickets we were told they were only valid in a different area that you have to walk to in the sun the same went for the x voucher of  idr  that were not valid to be used unless you went into the shops past the hot sunny rocks one thing we noticed was that no one  no one was smiling and happy at the exit of the park we saw wave after wave of people entering and just felt bad for what they would soon go though and what we just escapedthis park should be a great symbol of the heritage of bali instead it is run by a businessman who has deliberatly constructed a maze of fees to extract more money from you to be more fair just put a price up front of  idr  or  idr or whatever in contrast the tokyo tower cost is  the eiffel tower is  to the observation deck this trap makes people feel they were tricked conned and we have no desire to returnsave yourself hrs of time and skip this go have ice cream instead,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,i should say firstly that we were in two minds about visiting the park because of the mixed reviews most of which bad experiences however we enjoyed our time there yes the park isnt completed and the entry fee was expensive compared to other things to do but we thought it was worthwhile i feel that people disappointed with their experience may have gone with high expectations if you visit bali regularly or plan on doing so in the near future it might be worth holding off for a little bit as they have some great plans for this place but it looks like it will get busy with tourists with the plans they have a nice perk was that there werent many tourists and we were still able to see the main attractions of the park i will give some more details to see if you think it is worth itwe visited the park mid november  we walked to the park from a local hotel the walk from the main road to the ticket booth is quite a long way but not too challenging for those driving there are several parking areas leading up to the park entrance presumably for the expected higher capacity when the park is more complete at the entrance we received a leaflet with a map of points of interest in the park and paid k idr for our ticketentry fee included in this price was a free drink at the panoramic restaurant  min walk from the entrance and a sash with the statue on there are also hourly dance performances on at the amphitheatre considering that we paid k idr to see a trance and kecak fire dance in ubud we thought that the entry fee was very reasonable you get the most for your money if you manage to see everything at the park for those that arent interested in this and only want photos and to see the statue i can understand why this seems like an expensive ticketfrom the entrance there is a shuttle that can take you up to the wisnu kencana statue and then drops you off at another stop this service costs k idr the walk is very manageable it is uphill and may be difficult for the elderly or disabled at the moment there are no steps there from the ticket scanning area so it is accessible to wheelchairs there are also electric scooters you can rent by the hour from the festival park area cant quite remember the price personally i dont think this is worth it we saw some scooters not getting some guests all the way up the hill and it is only a  min walk from this point without stopping on the hillit is an additional price to go up into the statue we didnt do this as we didnt want to pay an extra fee these are also scheduled so you have to wait for the set time to go up to the observation areas i imagine the view is amazing though you can see some brilliant panoramic views from the statue at plaza wisnu and the jendela restaurant that offers the free drink with the entry ticketthe statue of wisnu is in a temple so you are giving a sarong at the bottom of the stairs on both entrances to this area from here we went to the amphitheatre to see a dance overall it was worthwhile and we had a great day even though the park isnt complete it was a good visit,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,it is an interesting park to visit has some great statues to see and a lot of history about them and the gods we left the scotter in the park were we paid  rupees there is a bus that takes us from the parking to the park ticket office an adult pays  rupees to enter and gain access to the gates they offer us  wipes as a gift and a welcome drink for those who want to have lunch there are numerous restaurants and cafes as well as warungs,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,reading other reviewswished that id done before the visit the ticketprices dropped in nov  to  child and  adultbut our experience is nearly the same as all other negative reviews you have to pay and pay and paythe positive twist on this moneydraintrip was the dance performance in the amfitheatrethats why  and not  rating,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,this is our first time visiting gwk i am impressed with the park the management the staff and the cleanliness of the park thumbs up the statues are amazing the entrance fee is decent the facilities are amazing a good place to go in bali which will give you different experience,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,this place is worth the drive out  beware taxi drivers telling there are no taxis returning and trying to get a return fare this place is incredible the statue itself is a wonderful achievement  the dance included is great to watch i would highly recommend this place the only thing is you are asked to pay for the ride up the hill to the entrance  seems they dont encourage you to walk  you can opt for the cart right up the hill which was worth it imo as it was so hot  it is tricky to get a gokek to come to the entrance on the return home  if you can walk half a kilometre towards the main road youll be fine for pick up there,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,out of the many places we have visited in bali this is the only one that we absolutely hated from the first minutefor starters the park is not finished there are endless closed areas construction sites and huge empty spaces everywhere not to mention the garbagethe entire attraction is designed to get as much money from all visitors as humanly possible after paying the entrance ticket idr  per person you are guided towards the shuttle service where you can pay more to be taken up to the statue we decided to walk on the way up to the statue they will try to get your money anyway half way up to the statue they will try to give you a scooter or a bike to rent or you can jump on the golf buggies for a further chargeonce you actually reach the statue they charge you idr  more to enter the building we decided not to pay it and only looked from the outsidethe park could have been nice if it was in a natural environment but they have placed it into an old quarry and poured concrete over it so it is absolutely disgraceful you pay hundreds of thousands just to look at one big and two smaller statuesbali has many amazing sights and experiences but not this one this whole park one of the darkest examples of mass tourism and money grabbing the only reason this place exists is to get as much money from you as possible while offering nothingsave yourself an afternoon and go somewhere else,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,this park has nothing good inside the same was written in online reviews however i still went ahead to be there bought tickets from klook which wa smooth to buy and redeemparking is k idrticket is around  idr on klook  on counter per person for nothing to seeonce you have redeemed ticketyou need to buy buggy ticket to go near garuda statue which is  idr sgd per person  this ticket on your way back only drop you until half way then you have to walk till shuttle stand and then go parking using shuttle busthis is total waste of money and timehowever entrance of the place till parking is long way and you would feel that you will get to see something good but its totally hopeless place all you see is statue of garuda just from the base of iti forgot to mention if you actually wanna go inside the statue you have to buy the ticket again separately which i believe is more than  sgd per person,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,still on construction everywhere except the statue nothing else to see one big disappoinment in bali,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,you get a grab or taxa to drive you therethat will be the first k to get in with a caryou get an entrance ticketthats kyou get confused as to where to go and see lots of people taking a golf car you buy tickets for that golf carthats kyou get to the statue and you want to go upthats kso far youve spend k and you are still a little confused as to why there are  statues in the middle of a construction siteif you are smart and prepared you only get to pay k and take the free view from the buddhai like things that make me feel small and the statues did the job so  stars,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,was there some years ago  not really being there as i am now and finally be able to experience it in fully i can say its all worth it some might have different opinions but i must say if you looking for party places where you can drink till you drop or do some other crazy regular tourist stuffthis place totally not for you if you are a person who appreciate culture arts or heritage this is a place to visit you can have the whole experiences in one place and not to mention it is one of the world icons,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,you have to admit that the statue stands out from afar in bali where no building is to be higher than a palm treeas soon as we arrived we have to pay rp  for parking our car rp  entrance fee for adults and rp  for children children shorter than m are freeyou can either do the  minutes walk to the statue or pay rp  for a one way ride to the statue everybody has to walk back because you have to walk pass all the shops and restaurantsweve been telling the kids since we landed in bali that were gonna go up on the statue to enjoy the scenery once we got to the statue we have to pay another rp  to go to the top and no children younger than  is allowedso why the hell is the children price at the gate and why nobody told us thisafter arguing with the person selling the tickets he finally said that were allowed to go upstairs which we denied the reason why children are not allowed in the first place is safety and security so what changed in the last  minutes while we were arguingin short dont go there its a rip off tourist trap,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,we were very excited to go and see this statue after seeing it from afar during our stay well it was a bit of a let down close up save your money and go elsewhere as this park is still under construction and everything is so far apart once up to the top you are asked to pay extra for the tour we didnt we caught the shuttle to the next statue further down for the impressive views instead dont be caught out here it is like a dubai park in the making and one day it will be worth the visit but id say hold on to your money until then,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,although this monument is vast in size and can be seen from kuta beach its actually still in the building stagewe didnt really understand what it is all about we hadnt planned going here but our driver thought we would like itits built out of an old quarry and will become a theme park but at the moment its a little bit underwhelming there will be the opportunity to go up to the viewing platform once complete and the views will be amazing the huge statues are quite impressive and do draw peoples attentionin my opinion i would suggest waiting till its complete to be able to get the full experience as currently its a little nondescript and im sure from looking at the proposed plans its going to be an amazing attraction,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,i agree with the reviews that it is expensive its very misleading what you get for the first entrance fee but in saying that we took the tour up inside the statue first to the th floor then to the rd it ended up just being the  of us on the tour the information that we were given about the statue was interesting  well presented i have no regrets paying the money to do it i enjoyed it,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,positives really big statue visible from far nice for few picturesnegatives boring and expensive its nothing there except the statue and dancing program ugly surrounding nothing to see expensive they charge you a lot for entrance then they charge you extra for a shuttle bus you dont need then they charge you extra more than for entrance for going up in the statue total is  idr or  usd for a statue nonsense,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,my friends and i visited this park since we were curious about the giant statue of vishnu very quickly we realized though that this place wasnt worth our time or money there are lots of additional fees beyond the rather large k entrance fee you want to skip a sweaty uphill walk to the statue that will be an extra fee you want the additional experience at the top of the statue that will be k extra want to ride more than halfway back down that will be extra too and youll be forced to walk by plenty of shops before you finally find the exit as well we didnt see any dances so maybe those are worthwhile but in general our experience left quite an unpleasant taste in our mouths the statue itself is cool but save your money and enjoy it from a distance for free,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,wonderful statue they have in here also kecak dance makes me proud so i decided to going with my friend also enjoy every moment in my life,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,so i had no idea what this was we just jumped in a taxi and said off to the big statueyou pay to get in the area and then walk a bit to find the gates once inside there is a traditional dance which was good and im glad i saw it there were  dances and musicians so it wasnt super fast you get to enjoy itafterwards the dancers stay and ask you to take photos all the while asking you to hurry up because its hot i get it it would be hot inside the big costumesafter that you make your way towards the statue honestly you walk through a whole lot of nothing big open hot paved areas no shadethere are electric scooters to hire here to drive up to the statue we did this and it was fun but its not far to drivewalk so not really much point once you get to the statue they want you to pay again so we jumped back on our scooters and forgot about iton the way back down the paths are super steep in fact an adult going up needs to practically walk it up as the scooters have minimum power on the way down one of our group came off and got hurt so if you have kids think twice about going up this hillback down there is a little courtyard where you can waste away the rest of you  mins hirethere is seriously no where else to take these scootersback outside again we got our free welcome drink which is like super sweet cordial and left there isnt much here at all,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,if youre wondering whats the big thing youll see on the left side of legian beach this is it theres an entrance fee for tourists once in the area you can either walk to go up or take their mini bus again for a fee there are shops and restaurants in the area nice place to take photos but the development is not yet completely finished,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya

4.0,i think is a must visit place with the kacak dance perfomanceat least once in lofe timei spend  hours there with the view and dance perfomance,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,i was quiet excited to see this as we drove past it on our way to uluwatu so we dedicated a morning to head back there on arrival the initial entrance was very grand and you were ushered into a car park payment from the car park you had to take a shuttle bus to the official entrance of the park here we were charged the entrance fee payment which seemed reasonable at first each in which were given a bundle of vouchers and tickets for discount at gift stores and restaurants which was a bit confusingonce we entered with our tickets we were told it was a minute uphill walk to the main statue and that it was advised to take another shuttle bus payment  as we shuttled our way up to the main statue it was immediately obvious that the park was no where near completed and looked like a large mining  construction siteas we arrived at the main statue we entered the base to be told we had to make a further payment if we wanted to go up the statue itself this seemed completely unfair and unjustwe decided to leave at that point and and made the walk back down to the entrance past pretty much rubble and vast emptinessthe site is popular for local tourists which also meant at the entrance there were stack loads of run down coaches that were chugging out constant black smoke from their exhaustsnot pleasantwe were very disappointed as we really wanted to gain a positive cultural experience here but we were very happy to leave amongst bails many unbelievably beautiful experiences this one is not ready to see,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,we thought we could just pull up for a photo stop as our driver had mentioned the importance of the place so we agreed to a visit paid  aud for the entrance then had to walk a long way to get into the entry point uphill then another steep uphill walk to get to the base for photoswe did want to go up inside the statue but didnt realise extra charge another aud to take the elevator and had to wait for the tour tired from long day at the beach we decided just to take quick photos only park map was only given to us because we asked at the base entrance and not given at entry point would have been helpful earlier over all interesting and glad we saw it great vantage point we just didnt realise a longer visit would have been good so didntmake the most of it plenty of cafe and snack spots and you can hire a buggy to drive you up instead off walking,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,beautiful place to spend a few hours walking around i do highly recommend paying the extra  for a shuttle to the top and walk back down,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,dont bother especially if you have young children you pay to get it then they tell you if you want to use the shuttle you pay extra then you arrive at garuda and they say you have to pay more to do the tour dont eat at the restaurant either it is very unappealing and also the welcome drink is disgusting not worth it at all,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,its really unfortunate but what was once a majestic statue the largest in indonesia is now something similar to a theme park there are souvenirs photos scooter rentals gift shops and even a starbucks we were so disappointed thinking we were going to see a little more culturalif you do go spend the extra few dollars to get the shuttle when you buy your tickets its quite a hike to the top and in the bali sun youll thank me,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya

4.0,big place lots to explore dont forget your bottles of water and your sun hat luckily they give you a map before you enter because this place is quite large and a little bit confusing to get around i attended the balinese dancing show which was beautiful the statues are huge and you can see the main one from anywhere in kuta off in the distance,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,the third tallest statue in the world can be seen here everything in this place is on the large size its a huge complex with lots of walking and stairs but plenty of places to sit down and take a break there is a shuttle at the entrance that will take you to the main statue you can also go up inside the shoulder but it is a separate charge and no cameras are allowed a guide tells you how the statue was made we found it interesting sarongs and belts are provided for you the parking lot is spacious and a trolley takes you to and from the entrance we enjoyed our visit,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya

3.0,well nothing much to dotired to walkwe see the great garuda wisnu kencana statue by shuttle bus with over passenger is not comfortable we just see the statue from the groundwe not allowed to see the statue from the inside closed not for public at that time in august we watched the dance as wellits was pretty good ,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,nice temple but take your wallet i walked up to the temple but you could hire a bike or electric scootet to push up the hill i had to laugh when i walk around the corner to see all the poeple pushing the bikes and electric scooters up the hill because they were not powerful to go up the hill and when i got to the top then got told i had to pay more to go in the temple and wait and hours for the next tour to in the temple managed to lost on the trip back down with a couple of other poeple as well i i would rather view from far away with a zoom lens,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,if i could have given  stars i would you pay k per person just to be able to walk to de foot of the statue once youre there and you want to go in you need to pay an extra of k per person ask your driver to drive to a spot nearby to be able to make a nice picture dont go in its uselessone free advice if there are large signes at the counter which say no refunds it has a reason ,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,as other reviewers have said this is place is expensive but on top of that its bad value thats why i rate it poorlyi dont mind expensive if the experience is amazing as my many other reviews attest gwk is not even close to amazingthe sculptures are largely cheap fibreglass facsimiles the dodgy carnival feel is added to by the weird selection of food starbucks for goodness sake and the truly horrific gift shop packed with absolutely brainless bali tat like bottle openers and mini surfboards who even wants a power adapter with gwk printed on itthe icing on the ripoff cake is saved for when you get to the main attractionfor five of us im m down to get this far and another k if you count the half day transport to get here at the base of the main statue im asked for a other k to use a lift to get up to the observation deck and gallery as if that isnt gouging enough for the privilege of this cost i am not allowed to take any sort of photographic device including my phone why well you probably guessed it because if i want pictures i have to buy theirs no thanksnot recommended if youre a student of hindu culture the cheap and gaudy treatment might amuse you for everyone else theres more culture in having a decent chat with a taxi driver,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,very disaponting its only made to rip off the tourists its not worth the money you start with paying  for the entrance but thats just the start and only for the entrance to the park to get into the building you have to pay again every step further pay again wanna drink  for a small bintang there are so much nicer things to see on bali defenetly not this theme park,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya

5.0,our day at the gwk cultural park was great so much to see lots of free shows all included in the addition price free shuttle too and from the car park the place is amazing to wander around the giant statue can be seen from all over the east of island well most of it  i was told that they are building a bridge from the smaller statue to the gwk statue the gig new one with a restaurant by the new statue should be something to see well worth a visit,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,lets start with i never thought i could get scammed seeing a statuewe paid to park the carwe paid to get in   little sign says kids under  free  when you get to the window its kids over cm pay and over cm pay as adults so scammed twice now  than the shuttle to the top you pay again   mind you unless you are a mountain climber you cant walk up   so we have finally arived and are greeted by a fountain with no water and a huge statue  than we are told if we want to go up its another ticket and more money  or  well you can walk around and look at a concrete unfinished building with a fountain with no water  so we say stuff it we are leaving  you have to pay to get a shuttle down  of we go again  but guess what they only take you half way down and not all the way so you can get scammed at all the retail along the way in short dont waste your time  bali is a great place but this is the greatest rip of ever  the place is filthy and what a waste of money and our time ,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya

3.0,garuda wisnu kencana is located in the southern badung area k per person entry fee which is high,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,bali money grab at its worstk per person entry feeonce inside they want to charge you for any and everythingthey make you stop so they take your photo before entering then want you to pay k for that photo when leavingthey want k pp if you want to go into the main statue and if youre stupid enough to do that then they insist that phones cameras and all your belongings are put into a locker wtf if you get tired from all the walking they want k pp to take you backdont bother youll be disappointed,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,this area is amazing and beautiful with huge structures it was a bit confusing where to go but once we worked out to be driven to the top of the hill and walk down and see everything as we descended a few more signs in english would be helpful but well worth a few hours spent there,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,entrance fee is a total rip off lacks proper signage no shed inside k for the entrance then additional k for the buggy and free welcome drink is powdered iced tea which is selfservice aside from the  big statue there nothing much inside the cultural show happens every hr from ampm but thats it what we see inside is way below our expectation and not worth k there are lots of tourist spots in bali where you spend less but get more than whats in there,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,flying into bali airport one is greeted by the massive presence of the gwk statue which is visible all along the beach strip from kuta legian and seminyak we couldnt wait to take a tour up to the cultural park and duly prepaid the au entrance fee there was a lot of preparation happening for a music festival that started the day after our visit so to be fair there was a lot of activity noise and the hustle and bustle we didnt seem visit during any of the cultural shows and were disappointed after trecking up the hill to the statue to find there was a further entrance fee of au  to get in then there is the photo package ranging from aus to aus food and drink memorabilia  for the golf buggy to get you down the hill why not up etc etc its almost like the balinese government has seen the venture as establishing a balinese disney world but forgot all the fun bits and skipped to fleecing of tourists so after spending up for travel and entry we ended up with photos of the statue that were no different to those we took from outside the campus with a good camera sorry but until there is some transparency in offering and price we cant recommend,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,been several times coming here and happy to revisit again since the place offer u a stunning view of massive built statuetry the ampitheater as well if u like to see cultural performance,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,not worth the trouble takes a long time to get there and a lot of walking once you have charges for parking entrance fee and also to get into the statue we ended just having lunch with our driver hotel packed it for us took a couple of photos at the entrance and left very crafty cant actually see the bg until you drive away from it and go down some side streets,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,gwk is balinese for tourist trap first they charge you  usd to get in the park then another few bucks to take the golf cart up the road then once you get up to statue its another  to go in the giant statue i didnt do the last  but im guessing once you get up there its another  for something then another  for something elsei have a more specific gripe that while i waited for my sucker friends who paid the additional  i bought ice cream for my wife and i i literally got  the ice cream she got now i get it im overweight but they didnt need to get all judgy on me and give me a tiny cone,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,we visited the gwk without homework and were disappointed to find that it was not an ancient spot besides the same time we could have invested in visiting nasa dua or other natural beautygwk is expensive idr per person needs  hours and not good on a sunny hot day there are two big statues to see the gwk has two tickets one for the entry and another for going up on gwkits a great engineering wonder for sure but i expected a natural or ancient marvel,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,staying in jimbaran the gwk statue is an imposing figure on the skylinewe thought we would pay it a visitentry fee of rph which we were aware of i really wanted to go up to see the view from inside the statuewhen you arrive to lobby inside you only then are told its another  to access the statue no thanksoverall the park was boring and still under construction in areasnot worth it in my opinion,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,they tell you this was built for tourists they cater to that and each thing you want to do is extra meaning the initial entry is one price and once youre in everything else is alacart just expect that the status is nice and its a nice walk but dont get your hopes up with the wow factor once the enormous size of the statue subsides it was nice but id probably say skip it even though its enormous and impressive when you walk up to it,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,we found it amazing definitely worth paying more to go up to the rd floor and learn how it was built totally blew us away ,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,basically they charge you about  auseach to go and look at a statue then if you want to go up inside the statue it costs even more nothing else to do there and barely any information it will be nice in a couple of years time when they have finished landscaping at the moment dont bother to go there,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,from a distance this statue looks like a cultural landmark but it is a newly built statue in the middle of a tourist park which is under constructionit was a waste of money place to avoid,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya

4.0,visited as part of a tour only had an hour or so to spend but the main statue is spectacular along with the others the scale is immense could easily spend  hours esp if you want to take in a show which we were unable to do the park itself is under construction so a little raw but overall very good,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,we first noticed this flying in a year ago so when we realised we were on the area  we had to come and visit up close lucky we had our driver with us as the process is an interesting one park in one area and get a shuttle to another area to purchase your tickets we also paid the extra for the shuttle thinking this for us up and back  it only takes you up  then you have to walk back so you can pass all of the shops and tourist sales  well played we didnt have enough time to do the  minutes tour and we were lucky the staff told us how long it would be interesting place and worth a visit,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya

3.0,the ticket as idrkperson which is quite expensive you will get a welcome drinks after you out from the placethe place it self is massive and the statue was so coolits worth to visit only one time the place it self still lot of renovation and not done the funny part is you need to pay again to go up which is non sense,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,expensive tourist trap with no history k pp to enter and you gain access to the cultural park and then have to pay extra to enter the statuethe park is an old quarry with the gwk statue a couple more smaller statues and a balinese theatre showing balinese dances and theatre in reality you are only going for a closer look at the statue this is impressive however dont feel warrants such cost compared to other attractions nearbythere are no locals using this facility for worshipping and was seemingly only built for touristsspent a while looking for the fountains and gardens as shown in art work however this does not exist confusing and misleading,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,it was the biggest statue i have ever seen yes it is still in development but it is spectacular and i hope they will finish it the park is massive and i would suggest using the shuttle to see the statue to go up into the statue does cost more there are also cultural shows and a temple,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,garuda statue was very satisfying to watch it is really huge never seen something like that in my life and the temples there are so nice and clean i really loved going there it was worthy,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,there are a few things to do here that are included in your entry price  temples to see and performances to view on the hour you can also hire out bikes to ride around if you arent physically able you can pay a fee for the shuttle up to the main temple as there are many steps and hill to climb otherwise the temple itself is relatively new so there are a lot of plans yet to be realised however for another fee you can pay to get to the top of the large statue of garuda wisna,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,paid  rp for entrance only to realise the main statue still charges extra plus it closed early at pm before we arrived besides the statue there really isnt much else to see in the park so for the price its really not worth itvery much a tourist super trap go only if you really want to get that up close view of the statue,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,rising from gently sloping bukit peninsula an enormous statue of garuda carrying wisnu commands your attention taller than nearly every other freestanding structure the gwk is best viewed at late afternoon when the colours of the metal vary from grey to green to gold admission is an easy process buy your ticket and walk make your visit a pilgrimage to the craftsmen who raised it and the history it portrays,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya

5.0,cant get over how large this statue is photo do not do it justice very hot and a lot of walking,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,an amazing statue that you see from the air flying in to bali the cultural park is earmarked for major expansion and covers a big site well organised with transport to the statue on a golf buggy entry up the statue costs more as does the trip in the golf buggy but we didnt have time to do the park fully the restaurant where you obtain your complimentary drink is tranquil with amazing views took great photos of the statues all in all a great visit,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,the statue is the third largest in the world and has been beautifully carved the entire cultural park is huge and in my opinion was over expensive the charges were pax there was not much to see in this price most of the other things like the museum had a separate entry ticket the balinese dance show was good food was expensive and not included we just got a small welcome drink the buggy was pax extra and dropped us one way only we had to walk all the way backif you are on a short trip to bali you can surely skip visiting this place,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,i really enjoyed this cultural parkits warm so take some water theres a fair bit of walking to do so if your not a walker than take the shuttle busgrab an ice cream on the way out to cool downa lot of reviews have people winging about the price but its a once off thing to go and seeappreciate the time and work that went into the rd biggest statue in the world,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,set in an old quarry although call cultural park impressive statues but to go up the big one they charge more money very much aimed at getting as much money out of tourists as possible very disappointing,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,it is a must visit place if you are visiting bali such a big stature of garud vishnu bali dance performances etc very well built,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,visit this statue is a mus if you go in bali buying the ticket will guarantee you access in a really nice park and you will see one of the biggest statue in the worldi suggest the visitors to complete the tour entering inside the statue the ticket is quiet expensive but the experience will deserve you the ticket price,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,impressively huge statues and nice scenery about  entrance fees if you can walk dont pay for the shuttle bus although its very cheap we went early in the morning but it might be nice to visit during sunset either way you shouldnt spent more than  hour there,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,theres been mixed reviews about this place but i think its world class this place has the feel of both petra and teotihuacan i think its worth visiting now and again a few years down the road as they continue to populate with other buildings and attractions,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,it is an absolutely massive statue which you can view from kuta beach and elsewhereit does remind me of the big buddha statue in phuket still not finished and bit of a tourist trap,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,the gwk statue can be seen from afar and it is spectacular up close entry is rp and due to time restriction i paid the extra rp to take the shuttle golf cart up which turned out to be an excellent time saver this takes you to the base of the statue then you can walk back from the plaza half way i didnt do the statue tour due to cost but also time but still felt like i got so much out of my visit the walk back down allows you to see the rest of the grounds which for people who did not take the golf cart would have to see twice and it is fantastic it was a little confusing for people like me who took the shuttle when collecting the welcome drink included iced lemon tea as you need to exit then walk back past the entrance to the cafe getting to the original ticket counter is then a short walk down the hill a shuttle service is available tofrom the car park allow for plenty of time if you want to see the shows in the amphitheatre andor tour up the statue  my rushed visit took mins,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,interesting but expensive we only did the grounds of the area didnt pay the extra to go into the statue might be more worthwhile when its totally completed its taken  years to get this far,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,we visited with friends who really wanted to see the big statue unaware of the entry fee and shuttle price we were surprised it was so high when we entered the main attraction there were large boards showing restaurants and skywalks etc but when we enquired it was master plan not yetto get to higher floors without camera i overheard it was a further  we walked most of the rest of the park found the lotus pond empty and have never had to walk and ask directions so many times ever for a welcome drink which we consumed on our way out  quite ridiculous it not worth the cost in my opinion id wait years till the master plan is completedand to top it off we got a staff member to take a photo of of the four of us in front of the big statue and he took just us and chopped most of the statue out,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,only go here if u like coach loads of people and doing selfies nothing authentic or historical has been built since  ralph lauren starbucks and other shops if your looking for something generic and mainstream a religious theme park with some franchises chucked in,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,the statue is very big and can be seen from far off however entry and tour is very expensive need proper arrangement at site to attract tourists,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,its a nice big park with about  huge statues and other small ones there is a garden and fountains the pathway is like carved from a mountain the tickets are k rp kids and seniors are cheaper and can also be bought online for k rp near the entrance there is an amphitheater where they play a different dance show every hour or so it was very nice to watch the dancers with different costumes to get up into the big garuda statue it costs an extra k rp but we didnt care to enter it also photos are forbidden inside the statue it took us maximum  hour to walk and take photos in all the park maybe an extra half hour to watch the dance show in the theater the price seems fair considering the nice views the dance shows and also they give a complimentary drink and a gift scarf with the logo of the place overall if you are near the neighborhood then its nice maybe not worth it so much if you are far note it was a short walk total about  km so there was no need to wait or ride any shuttles unless you have seniors or kids we were there on a friday around  and  pm but the park is wide so we didnt feel any crowd also inside and outside the park there is drink and food booths if you need anything,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,the gwk statue can be seen from afar so you would want to see it up close visiting the park doesnt come cheap however the locals themselves find it very expensive your entrance fee does not cover going up the statue which they do not mention at the entrance gates and you only find out upon reaching the elevator area to go to the top the staff will also try to trick you into taking the shuttle for an additional fee per head on the notion that going to the main statue is a  minute walk in truth it is a short walk you just have to deal with the heat and maneuver a short uphill before reaching the statue you find this out because no shuttle takes you back to the entrance area you have to walk back the activity area would have been fun the cultural shows are a treat but the time between shows were too far apart,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,it looked amazing from a distance on how huge it is there was a fee to get in but a little bit extra to take the buggy to the top we took the buggy option as it was too hot to walk up when we got to the top there was an extra fee to go right up to the statue which look boring it looks better from a distance close up is not as amusing as i thought then there was a long as walk in a huge park which is still being developed the signs are not that helpful so getting out of the park was a mission its a money making scheme which is definitely not worth it just have a look from outside dont need to enter the park,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,we visited the statue park at our guidedrivers recommendation we had previously seen the vishnugaruda statue from the beach in seminyak we were curious as to how it looked close up and what else was to see in the cultural park our driver left us at the parking spot we then catched a tiny and very crowded minibus to the park entrance tickets forpark entrance was  each we had the option of paying  more for a transporter further up we chose to walk as did most others after  minutes we reached the main statue it came as a surprise that a further  would have to be paid to enter the statue building there was very little information as to what that would give us we opted out and walked down instead in retrospect the park and statutes are quite uninteresting the park is large and you should be prepared for some walking where entertainment to walking ratio is very low all in all we felt a visit to the park was not worth neither the time nor the money we spent,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,many years people waiting for garuda wisnu kencana cultural park fully open this place so huge and so amazing the big garuda wisnu kencana statue i guest on of the masterpiece in the world customize handmade by men with high skill talented craftmentship inside as a starter we can watch a tradisional magical keris dance with barong and balinese tradisional music intrument gamelan after watch this beautiful dance we can explore fhe whole area take your time and your energy to walk reaching the statue on the top of cultural parkthumbs up for this amazing place,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,we spent a few hours here enjoying the theatre and dance performances along with the very impressive statues the largest being the garuda wisnu kencana which is the fourth tallest statue in the worldthere are several plazas depicting different aspects of balinese culturewe were there during a holiday period so it was very busy but that did not spoil the outing you park in a car park and catch a shuttle bus to the centre that is where you purchase you entrance ticket there are several shops and places to purchase food and drink we had a drink at the bebek bengil restaurant which was very pleasant and had a commanding viewall in all this is a very worthwhile excursion,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,we visited here thinking that a cultural park would have more than just a bunch of really big statues but we were disappointed great photo opportunities but not really much to do this place felt very sterile the real bali is in the streets not in this overpriced tourist attraction,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,we really enjoyed looking at the various statues the main statue garuda wisnu is impressive due to its size appearance to level of detail we stayed for the dance performance which was good but dragged on too long for my liking despite  degrees at the beach it was chilly at night on the hill so take a light jacket,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,our first stop was the gwk cultural park it is the number one cultural icon in bali the garuda wisnu kencana statue is designed to be one of the worlds largest and highest monumental statue in the world,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,i still have mixed feelings about this place there was not much to see and the ticket should really include going to the top of the tower as views were not that great from most areas of the park the cultural shows were good but the entrance should be before the amphitheatre so it is easy to access once you are in the park on the way out they put on an invisible mark incase you wanted to come back in after shows the free drink is over the road a the posher restaurant check the mame on the ticket,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,we spotted the garuda from our hotel and whilst walking on jimbaran beach and decided to take a closer look as part of a privately organised tour entrance fees seemed a little high initially but after wed spent  minutes looking at the garuda the lotus garden and other statues we felt it was educational worthwhile and money well spent the balinese dance show at the amphitheater is an obvious tourist attraction but was really enjoyable and you can have your picture taken with the dancers at the end watch out for a timeshare type of scam just before you enter the attraction they offer rewards including a free holiday if you attend a presentation at a hotel,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,entrance  is not less for a cultural place where many things are still in project the theater with the traditional dances are interesting and the statue is also impressive other services are not free of charge only shuttle service is for free nice place to spend  hours included with family,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,dont expect the same kind of experience you get when visiting an ancient place large park with impressive statues and interesting corners you either walk up the entire way or take a buggy car shuttle service  recommended especially in high sessiondidnt do the gwk statue tour just walked around the area and enjoyed the surroundingsgetting to know the history was interesting as well,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,we liked this place fantastic statues and nice surroundings had a glass at a nice restaurant with a great view,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,if you have the budget and dont like uphill walking take every shuttle they offer go early  stay late even after dark to enjoy the lighting everywhere weekends are the most crowded dont be in a hurry and expect long lines but shorter than disneyland do it up right including the trip up halfway to the top  plan on spending around  each including eats go in the dry season between may and september speaking english is no problem but keep it simple do your homework online before going find out as much as you can up front  you will appreciate your time in the park all the more,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,just another one of balis way of taking advantage of the tourists the park had an expensive entrance fee you could handle if the organization and knowledge of the workers were visible we were given the wrong entrance ticket and had to argue with them to make good we spent more time getting the ticket straightened out then we were in the park you can see all the cultural highlights other places therefore not necessary to visit,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,the entrance fee is expensive the shuttle bus from parking to the entrance site is unorganised there is no official staff who manages the queue there is no clear queue barrier so people just cut in lineaside from that the garuda wisnu kencana statue is impressively beautiful,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,we visited the gwk on a short day trip it is a very beautiful site with helpful staff and well worth a visit the show in the auditorium was amazing and authentic,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,gwk cultural park id intended to educate especially the young generations about the importance of preserving and cultivating worlds cultural heritage gwk or garuda wisnu kencana is a name for vishnu hindu god who rides his mystical half man and half bird companion known as garuda gwk is a great creation of renowned balinese artist i nyoman nuarta,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,the sheer scale of gwk is impressive but the site is very touristy but still worth a visit there are a number of smaller status through the complex but there is no doubt as to what commands your attention,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,while this might have felt a bit like disneyland it was a nice experience first of all there was a short wait for the shuttle buses and there were a lot of people here however it really doesnt feel over crowded once inside if you enjoy walking this is for you i would say expect to stay at least  minutes here some really impressive statues and even watched some dancing my daughter was pulled up on stage i didnt like that they wanted an additional fee to get up to the top of the statue after paying an admission fee i bought gelato instead next to the elevators,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,visited the big garuda which is visible from most spots in baliit is worth the  aud to travel to the top of this gigantic building the history of how it was built is worth hearing amazing the only downfall is that if you are over  they wont let you travel to the top in case you get dizzy it took a lot of convincing to let us  fit over s travel to the top  no dizziness no different than being in any tall building although there are a few spots of glass flooring so that you can see the construction below because it is so dark you cant see enough to make anyone dizzy well worth a visit,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,a fascinating introduction to the history  culture of the balinese people be prepared for plenty of walking but its certainy worth it,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,this might be illegal but if you have a chance fly a drone there the view is just amazing very nice and quiet place to just relax,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,this cultural park is recommended but need more improvement please add more chairsseats for peopledrivers who are waiting for their guests at the parking area need more shuttle bus so the guests dont have to queue for long time,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,amazing monument of the ruler of the world lord vishnu who is one amongst the three iebramha vishnu mahesh three but one the creator the caretaker and the destroyereverybody present in this world be it anyone existing in this world has to go thru this cycle to end up where you came fromtherefore this tall statue of the lord reminds you that you dont have to forget the vishnu who is taking care of you while you exist in this worldan amazing statue which reminds you of the god the rulercome here to bow and thank him for making you what you are and thank the mentora must must place when you are in uluwatu,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,this is fantastic not quite finished yet but if all the projected plans are finalized it will be an amazing sight cant wait to return and see the finished product well worth a visit now and in the future,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,we visited as we were passing by with our driver so thought why not it was quite expensive considering we were probably only there for about  hour we didnt even bother walking all the way to the gwk statue didnt expect to see other statues so that made it a bit more interesting,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,i was severely disappointed with the entrance to the park was organised we wished to visit the statue before we headed for the airport for our flight and allocated sufficient time to be able to go up and see the statue and be back to avoid traffic delaysupon buying our tickets which were non refundable we had to wait  minutes or so to enter the park due to maintenance issues and was provided no indication of when this would be addressed given the time constraints we also bought one way only option tickets to the shuttle bus service to take us up faster than walking this was another disappointment as it only operated till pm which is odd given the park was open till late we still had to wait with no information on timeframes and unfortunately had to leave without entering the parkvery disappointed i did not get to see the statue it would have been much better if everything was organised especially with the shuttle bus service operating hours and informing us of the rationale behind the maintainence delays which did not allow us to enter the parkwe would not have wasted money on tickets had we known there was maintenance issues delaying entrance i find it very dishonest that the ticket counter would not inform us of this,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,this is definitely a tourist trap you arrive and are asked to pay entrance which is fine then you get to the statue and are forced to pay again to take a  min guided tour to explain the construction process etc for an additional you cannot hi up the statue on your own then the cherry on the top is youre not allowed to take photos when you go into the statue whats the point the view is supposedly breathtaking but you cannot capture it staff is also not proficient in english and the whole process is tedious not worth it,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,good place to visit and spend hrs charming garden however do not expect any decent guide or headset or even a note to share the story of the place extremely poor organization also similarly to many places in bali expect to pay extra to see or do anything especially if you want to go up the statue nothing was mentioned at the ticketing area sight,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,excellent place to visit to look at the holy place with a divine culture of bali inside the gwk cultural park,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,excellent attractions a mammoth statue which is both a spiritual attractions as well as tourist attractions,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,right from the start when the red shuttle vehicle has to queue with the exiting motor vehicles from the car park you realise this gig hasnt been well thought outwhy is there a man with a red flag directing traffic in and out of the one vehicle gate on a rough road open it up get cars movingticket in hand we got up to the base only to realise they want another  to go up we did not see anyone queuing to go up and neither of the  tour groups during our time had bothered going upmy suggestion streamline and simplify your operation  ticket which includes going up inside at a more affordable price,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,we have made many trips here from the early days when bits and pieces of the statue could be found all around the parkwe visited two weeks ago looking forward to finally seeing the finished statuethe statue is truly awesome totally dominating your view as you walk up to the basewe were tossing up whether to cough up the extra rp per person for the trip up inside the statuethe decision was made easy when we were informed of the rules people over  not allowed children under  not allowed personal cameras phones etc not allowed if you want photos taken from balis best viewing platform you pay extra the trip up in the lift was part of a  minute guided tourour family party of six had two over s and two under snone of us really felt like walking round behind a guide listening to information which is freely available elsewheremost of the groups we encountered had kids and oldies our observations suggested that about half of the visitors would be excluded from the full tour seems a very shortsighted approach by the management of the park maybe they would like us to spend our rpm on some other cultural activity  like waterbom,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,good looking and great place still under contruction for another destination free shuttle bus from parking area,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,there are not many theme parks in south bali so gwk is a nice activity you can spend half a day there mixing visits of the park and watching the various shows in the amphitheatre overall the k entrance fee is reasonable considering the shows we get to watch the statues and the venue in general are impressive i would definitely recommend the place many things are extra once you enter but they are not necessary no need to go up the statue no need to take their extra transport to the statue,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,disappointing from start to finish sad to say that this is a bad tourist trap we expected the expensive entrance fee would cover you going up to the top of the statue but to our disbelief it doesnt the first part is walking through the park of which you see a couple of other statues and then you walk up a hill and you come to the gwk it is huge but why should we pay more to go up we were there for literally half an hour before we left,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,i went to gwk park without any expectation when i stepped into the park i was totally stunned its a huge place with the mysterious garuda bird man on the top of a huge mountain many other hindu religious status are around as well highly recommended,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,cant remember if i paid for parking if yes its between idrk for bikeentrance fee is idrpax which includes a free welcome drink a souvenier which is like a thin scarf for blindfold  access to cultural show and animated film should you require the shuttle to gwk statue its additional idrpaxthere is no need to take the shuttle its really not that far of a walk  only take it if you are physcially unfit and inconvenient to walkyou have to go down the stairs to get to the ticket counter then come back up and walk towards right for the entrancebefore you scan your ticket on the right make sure you head to the restaurant on the left first because the complimentary welcome drink is at the restaurant there however we made the mistake and scan the ticket and could not come back out we did the cultural show first was about  hour its pretty interesting to see we stayed and watched the whole thing theres chance to take pictures with the cast at the end of it i didnt do thatthe park looks really huge but when you actually start walking and checking out the statues you realize you cover the areas pretty fast of course the park is filled with tourist you can also rent bicycles to ride up to gwk statue and around the bicycle area you cant ride everywhere there are stairs before you arrive at the bicycle area so i dont really see a point in renting a biketheres fooddrink trucks area we got a juice and milo its expensive bring your own bottled drink if you want to save money and the way the juice is prepared is pretty disgusting the table is in front of the truck orange not washed cut in half and immediately put on the squeezer we continued walking and arrived at the gwk statue its huge but you cannot get anywhere near it because you would need to pay an additional idrpax for a tour up the statue im not paying that much for a statue for we did not do the touri think idrpax is pretty decent to pay for the humongous statues and cultural shows you should defintely check it out at least once,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,this place has many attraction to see like a balinese dance performance souvenir soup that selling balinese handy craft and etcnot only that the biggest wisnu statue is located here garuda wisnu the complete name of the statue is one the biggest statue in the world,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,we were dropped off by our hotel on a shuttle run and that was a huge mistake you buy your ticket for  each or  if senior if you are prepared to walk up hill for twenty minutes ok if not another  to go by shuttle you reach the top where the statue is and walk into building then to find out it will cost you another  for the tour into the statue once done catch the shuttle down but only half way down you then have opportunity to look at the cultural park a lot lf nothing then a ten minute walk back to start the best way to see the statue is by taxi or tour where they will wait for you otherwise their is no other transport available we rang for bluebird taxi twice waited two hours no taxi came we would have been in serious trouble if another driver didnt offer to drop us back to a shopping centre where we got a taxi back to the hotel it is not worth the effort or the money,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,dont waste your time and money they charge you  aud to get in then they dont tell you the buggie ride to the statue is extra per person then theres an extra charge to catch the lift and do the tour it would be good if they tell you all the information up front the statue is cool but you can see it from any where,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,the cultural park itself is amazing as are the structures it would be nice if you were given a bit more information about the various structures and what they represent,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,a very impressive set upbut not for young children or those that dont walk to walk for milesapprox aud to enter theres a cinema experience to tell you the gwk story then its a huge walk through the cultural centre lots of stairs to contented with the walk from the gate to the cultural centre is about mtrs we had a yr old with us and were told shed be fineno way simply to much for her little legs but kids under mtrs are freeplenty of shops and food areasremember this is a cultural place and a place of worship so you will be required to cover up no bikinis singlets etc  there are sarongs available for free whilst touring the gwk area,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,th tallest statue in the world taken  yrs to build been watching the progress over the year expensive for what it is  not very well organised entrance fee approx  then to go to the viewing gallery another  didnt go to viewing gallery as the wait was over  hours,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,only one reason to visit is the vishnu statue its the tallest hindu statue in the world rest there is nothing much to see at k idr its a bit expensive entry fees,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,i recommend to visit this place for half day after lunch there are some shows performed hourly and the latest show is kecak dance not as good as in pura uluwatu but still a great show you can also enjoy the sunset from here the admission fee is k rupiah for adult but you need to pay again k for a ride into the statue the complex is very wide you can also walk by yourself or rent a bike for k not recommended because the road is hilly what disappointing us is we must pay another k for the lift inside the statue overall it is a good place to chill around on afternoon towards evening,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,i decided to visit gwk today and have to say the place is beautiful and a marvel in what they have built butim very disappointed in the operation in the pricing and the clarity of the pricing and information firstly you pay  per person to get in which i was expecting to be able to go up and see the temple and then walk around inside this was not the case once i had paid my park admission and went to the statue i then had to pay another  per person to be able to walk around inside this too me was crazy and was not clear from the beginning the queue lines are very disorganised as well as the busses and transport services considering how hot it is there there was  us including  small children and we paid over  to get a look basicallyi will not be going back again,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,this park have the th biggest sculpture on the world it was amazing to be so close to it the entire venue is so beautiful a sight not to be missed when you visit bali do visit this place when uou in bali we loved the play at the theatre and the restaurants had lovely food that we enjoyed after our lonh tour at this park,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,great view to take pictures with friends and family and this place has just been completed in  location near jimbaran from kuta around  minutesticket price rp  person,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,this statue is impressive however you have to pay to enter park and then pay to go up the statue it cost  rp per person to enter park and  rp per person to go up you can catch the free shuttle from car park to enterance to park you can also pay an extra  rp to catch golf cart to statue  i recommend this the walk back to shuttle pick up is easier you are best to hire driver for the day and include this in your day as it is easier to have driver waiting for you when your finished rather than trying to find taxi or grab,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,what a truely beautiful place not quite finished yet but if the displays of future plans are anything to go by it wil be wonderful the statues are enormous and can be seen from the beach in seminyak cant wait to revisit when its all done,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,ive read some of the other reviews from other visitors and as a consequence have given this a  star rating it really annoys me when people go to a developing country and rate them compared to a st world country usually where they come from  because they can afford it then whinge about how much it costs i think it was about  nz which   coffeesanyway rant overat least half a day is needed to mooch around the park which is still in progress the main centre piece is very impressive and is taller than the statue of liberty i saw it from the plane when coming in to landi was equally impressed by the massive and i mean massive earthworks that have been done to create the passageways between the  metre tall hillsthere is a fab area with a group of vw combi vans selling various snacks and food of great qualitytaste and a very reasonable priceyou can hire segways and bicycles if you fancy or just jump in a taxi a golf cart type thing i prefered to walk but its good to bear in mind if your less than fit or senior in agebe sure to get to the actual garudavishna monument before pm as if you are later it may not be possible for you to climb the huge amount of stairs to get an awesome viewi was also fortunate to catch a live dance interpretation of the story behind vishna and garuda in the amphitheatre at about pm i think  check for the time this was included in the entrance fee oh plus a free drink from the bar near the theatreexpensive my ass,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,after seeing the monument on the horizon i wanted to visit the park the work they have done on this old quarry so far is very impressive we are glad we went to have a look but would have preferred them to be open about it not being finished yet you can not go up inside it at all only inside the ground floor lobby where there are many pictures of whats to come next there is  lift wells ate the end of the lobby that are boarded up or closed there is a lot more work to be done based on their own photos within the base of the statue,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,we watched gwk being constructed over several years from our hotel so this trip we visited it is an amazing structure and a close up view is a must the cultural park provides a very educational history through dance and printed information there is plenty to see and do in the park plus a restaurant  shopping i recommend spending at least half a day here to take advantage of all the cultural park has to offer,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,a large brass sculpture that is worth seeing up close still fairy new and lacking many touristy ttractions it is worth seeing the statue just for its sixe,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,i find the entrance fee to be very expensive and overrated yes while the  structures are magnificently built but it doesnt warrant that entrance fee could have gone to better places and put money to be use still a lot of construction and beautification works to be done sad for such commercialism,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,it is a very big statue of vishnu on garuda the park is good and you have to walk so long to reach the big statue there are so many shops in between this is the statue one will be attracted from the flight during landing when we visited there are some works going on so we were not allowed to go up to the view point,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
1.0,you should visit another place in bali here very terrible only money trap very expensive for bali  australian dollar only for rubbish,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,garuda wisnu kencana cultural park is a must visit place in baliwell organized parkshuttles available from parking to entrancesmall cart available with some extra charges from entrance to main statue which is helpful for elderly people meters tall state of lord vishnu with garudath tallest statue in the world which you can see even from airport or flighttraditional balinese dance shows free insiderestaurants and shopping center available insidelarge area so some elderly may find it tiring but worth visiting,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,before my plane landed on bali i could see a tall structure rising above all the other buildings it was only when my driver suggested visiting the garuda wisnu kencana or gwk statue that i realised that this was it our taxi went halfway up the hill and had to park there we had to wait for a shuttle to bring us higher up to the ticket counter from there another shuttle brought us up the hill from there we could either take a pedestal tour shelter up or walk up we didnt want to miss the old statues of lord wisnu and garuda a mystical bird so we walked up it was getting hotter and i was happy i had my wide brimmed hat on we walked past a wide open court with teenagers riding segway and scooters which they rented luckily the map given to us was in english we walked up the slope and there before us was the gwk on top of a building with a hall of gallery photos it is the fourth tallest building in the world kencana means gold so both garuda n lord wisnu wore crowns of gold the statue is actually lord wisnu riding garuda in hindu mythology going down was easier and we bypassed the old statues and two ladies pointed us the exit through the souvenir or oleh oleh shop we walked down to the ticket counter where our driver was waiting for us,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,the fact that the main statue is not open for admission should have been made clear at ticketing counter especially for the buggy ride of k its not a lot of money but when the mins ride takes you to a statue you can only view from the base it feels like a tourist trap,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,finally after a few trips over the last few years it wasgreat to go and seeif finally finished thegrouds and landscaping have no been done completely yet but still worth the tripmy tip pay the k  and get the buggie as its a long walk on rough ground otherwi see e and up hill  steps,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya

2.0,the giant statue of garuda is breathtaking however the venue isnt even close to ready by paying over k rupiah for an entrance ticket you find unfinished roads mountains and a lot of rubblemaybe another  months and once the park is fully ready it maybe a good spot but right now ill pass as the  hours we spent tofro plus at the site wasnt worth it,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,this statue and balinese cultural centre is still under construction but the huge wisnu statue  bigger than the statue of liberty  and centrepiece of the place is finished and looks north over the island theres quite a bit of walking involved unless you opt to pay more for a buggy its clearly aimed at fleecing tourists with included extras like the free drinks that are impossible to find and the transfer bus staff are officious and largely unfriendly but the statue is impressive,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,a must visit absolutely amazing lots of walking and lots of steps however there are golf carts to the top if you cant do a lot of walking from the top you can see to the airport and beaches on a clear day very interesting couple of hours,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,we visited here at the beginning of he month it was plenty to see and to do seeing the size is impressive we couldnt go up inside as i was not finished at the time our bluebird driver came with us and helped us around with photos and translating very friendly nice people,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
3.0,the cost of this for our family of  was aud i had impression that we could go up into the statue and look at the view this is not the case we used the buggy to take us up the hill and walked down whilst at the statue you can walk inside to a toilet and ice cream vendor probably the best attraction is the walk up at present as the roadway for buggy is unfinished statue is impressive but i think could be priced more appropriately for what you get  a photo opportunity would recommend a drive by at present but hope that in years to come when the area is complete that this will be a great tourist destination not quite there yet,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,really very nice placei will come here again with my faimly u can see here about garud and god vishnu,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
4.0,was interesting if you want a good culture fix then this is the place to go enjoyed my time there,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
5.0,entrance rate for adult foreigner is  the grounds leading up to the enormous garuda wisnu are nothing short of amazing taking a simple concept of creating multiple rows of massive pillars of solid stone these cut out pillars of solid stone are so huge that trees are growing on them walking through these simple pillars  over a block long and several pillars deep its an overwhelming feeling of grandeur this being executed by removing the negative space from the existing land formation simple but amazingthen you see the first huge monument the another even larger and finally the largest being garuda wisnuwithin the park which is like walking through a modernist living art gallerythere is also restaurants and food trucks which are converted vw vans can rent a segway and there are loads of areas to practicebetween each exhibit is a mind blowing courtyard there are retail shops photo opportunities and clean bathroomslast bit for a small amount you can rent a ride up to the final statue and then ride or walk back which is downhillthe facility is not completely done as it has many components to follow but these include a splash park and a few more exhibits this is all explained through drawings displayed in the bottom of garuda wisnu,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya

5.0,we visited gwk on a whim as we were staying nearby and had seen the impressive monument when flying in what an amazing sight it was a pleasant walk through the park to the statue itself with cool areas and nice views as we progressed up the hilldespite the length of the walk and the heat we didnt find the walk overwhelming  my mum has hipback issues and my daughter is only  but we managed the walk just fine you can also rent golf carts or bikes to do this at the top you can walk under the statue and theres a gelato stand which was nice the park is unfinished so you cant go up the monument yet but when you can thats going to be awesomethe plans for the park look very impressive so when we are next are in bali i look forward to seeing the completed park i hope there are more signs as part of the plan as it would have been nice to have more guided information about what we were seeing  but i suspect that signs like the rest of the park arent yet completed,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya
2.0,the long wait for a ticket was a poor start to our visit combine that with another hour wait in the humidity for a golf cart to take us up to the statue and our overall experience was a waste of timewhile the actual statue is impressive there is really nothing else there to see as yet you cant view the statue without paying for parking a ticket for just being there and then additional for the golf cartdissapointing day all round,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,Bali,Budaya

5.0,the view is very charming many traditions or activities that can be done there such as seeing snakes in the cave holy water and aesthetic temples,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
4.0,we stayed in the temple complex so went early morning although we didnt get there in any rush we did still beat the majority of the tourists tanah lot translates to land in the sea due to the temple sitting on an offshore rock and that lends to why its considered such a beautiful temple when we visited the tide was out which allowed us to walk right up the temple a little warning that when the tide is out the floor can be quite slippy so tread carefully,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
5.0,we visited this temple on one of the hindu religious day and it was really busythe best time to go one hour before sunset the temple is on a rock in an island which is shaped by the tides sound of the waves is very refreshing the sea is absolutely clean and reflects the blue skythere are lots of shops along the road going to the temple from the entrance this is a must visit and one my favorite place in bali,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya

4.0,better to see it from the hillside above in order to get a full perceptive not too many people due to the virus probably ahrd to appreciate with large crowds,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
4.0,this temple is one of the most recognisable indonesian landmarks its a beautiful spot although very crowded which means its spiritual halo is long gone but i would recommend it to anyone it is best to book a tour because getting there is hard from denpasar i tried with public transport i made it but i had to catch a cab to go back spending a fortune the ticket for the temple is worth the money,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
4.0,tanah lot was our last stop for the day our tour agent had to drive fast  dodge traffic in order to reach the place before sunset we were just in time as traffic was really badtanah lot is an ancient hindu pilgrimage temple located in tabanan in the balinese language tanah is earth or land  lot is sea hence tanah lot simply means land in the sea it was built on a acre large rock known as gili beo in the th century a religious figure dang hyang nirartha had spent a night on it  was inspired to build a shrine as well apparently using his magical powers he moved the rock to the sea  ordered the people to build the temple to worship the sea god bhatara segara it is said that dang hyang had also created a poisonous snake from his sash which is believed to be living at the base of the rocky island to safeguard the templehowever the temples rock had started to crumble in  a loan was then given by the japanese government which led to a massive restoration project more than  of the offshore rock is now artificial also interestingly enough there is a cave with a magical spring underneath tanah lot the water is fresh although the temple is surrounded by salt waterin order to go to the temple you will have to cross some dry land during low tide  then climb a footpath hill we did not attempt to do so as it was already getting dark  the tide was getting high also there were just too many people below the temple we could only see the rock from afar however the view was breathtaking it was like a postcard picture  we busied ourselves with selfie momentsthe entrance fee to tanah lot is idr parking is also chargeable it is opened from  am   pm the best time to visit is probably between  pm   pm or just before sunset as the view is simply stunning however expect hoards of people to be there with you too another alternative is to go during low tide then you can walk to the temple using the walkways from the parking lot i think that is as close as you can get as visitors are not allowed to go in unless it is for worship purposes in addition there is a tanah lot ceremony held every  days following the balinese calendar which will take place for  dayswe saw rows  rows of shops for tourists to buy souvenirs  knickknacks nearby my travelling partner had bought a small set of phallic key chains for her friend as they were regarded as popular souvenirs from bali as for me i had bought a few materials for an aunt  cousin unfortunately the shops had started to close after sunset thus we did not have much time to shop which was good so come early shop st before you go to the temple or before taking the numerous sunset shots dont forget to buy the local grilled corn  the refreshing coconut water it will definitely quench your thirst in the heat,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
3.0,whilst its a beautiful place to see its not like you could see that much you couldnt enter any temples so it was all from afarthe shops that there were were good we went into the ralph lauren shop and were treated beautifully and the cost was less than australiawe met some cute luwaks and had the coffee at one of the coffee shopsit was quite a busy place many people there to see the temple over the water which we couldnt access as it was high tide,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya

5.0,the tanah lot temple is at the northwest side of bali which takes a long time for transportationbut when you see the sunset view with countless bats flying over your headeverything is worth to do so,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
2.0,now i understand that this place is sacred to the hindu culture and religion and i can and do respect that it holds great value to the balinese but as a traveller it is was one of the most underwhelming sights i went to see in a  hr trip to see the top  places it was a  hour drive that i cant say was worth it for me but considering the reviews i am the odd one out there is a cultural village that situated around the temple for you to walk around but it sells the same things that every other store sells however i took advantage of the pretty surrounding scenery and took some good photos but not worth a  hour journey from ubud,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
5.0,we visited the tanah lot temple on march th and lucked out  happened to visit during their semiannual ceremony its one of  sea temples to worship the balinese sea gods and dates back to the th century the structure is breathtakingly beautiful as is the surrounding beach area although there was quite a bit of trash which was disappointing to seeall in all it was a fantastic experience and a beautiful temple to visit,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya

5.0,this is a wonderful temple that is justly famous however it took me a very long car trip on extremely conjested roads to get there from sanur which is actually not far away once there there is an entrance fee and hundreds of stalls to pass through before getting onto the terraces overlooking the ocean and the possibility of walking down toward the temple on the rock it is considered a sacred site of great significance despite the hundreds of tourists and as such reminds me of large temples in india and the great cathedrals of europe that welcome both cultural tourists and the devout one day i would like to stay nearby and visit in the early morning before the tour buses arrive,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya

2.0,you may feel disappointed after traveling there for an hour or two the issue is that you cant see the temple properly  it hidden by the trees you cant go inside at least during regular hours there are too many people around the seacoast itself is nice and the seaside view but there are many more nice beaches with fewer people a calm atmosphere and free admission,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya

5.0,among the temples we visited on a daylong tour this one was unique set on the beach it is a dramatic sight once we walked past all the vendors and got to the ocean it was refreshing on a hot day to be at the beach with the pounding waves we enjoyed walking along the shore and seeing several interesting land formations including an arched rock out in the ocean we liked that the vendors and the temple were really very separated so we could enjoy the peaceful setting first and then do some shopping,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
2.0,the sunset was pretty beautiful not much to see there except for walking along the beach and the temple i would not have came here except that my family wanted to as i thought it was slightly overratedour experience was also marred by a scam at a fruit juice shop in the complex it was a chinese fruit juice stall youll see chinese words advertising advocado ice cream and smoothies the chinese owner was proactive in getting us to go in and was fervent in recommending the menu however she intentionally failed to tell us that her menu charges in chinese yuan instead of the local currency idr imagine our shock when our bill turned out to be almost three times the normal rate in bali we informed her that it was very expensive and we didnt know her currency was not local and she plaintively ignored our comments we felt deliberately misled by her none of her local staff dared to bring us the bill and she was the only one collecting orders and paymentswe could have been more cautious with the menu but we definitely did not expected to be charged a different currency from idr please beware of this shop,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
5.0,on a recent trip to bali we were recommended to see tanah lot and we werent dissappointed stuck out in the indian ocean is this stunning temple built on a huge rock and only accesible at low tide its always very busy with lots of tourists but thats not surprising it jaw dropping when stood in front of it,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya

5.0,loved the sea and waves surrounding this beautiful temple yes there are lots of people but its a lovely attraction to see you need to walk down passed lots of souvenir shops which i loved and it would be a great place just to go for the shopping as it was less busy than the ubud market and cheaper i enjoyed this temple the best because the wind and ocean view gave some respite from the heat sunset is the best time to go,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
3.0,we were sold on taking the  hour drive from ubud to tanah lot by the level of importance this sea temple has for a cultural perspective however its surrounded by tatty souvenir stands has parking lots to serve lots of tour buses and is overrun by crowds really taking away from the mysticism of the temple pushy tourists impatient tour guides just not really creating the environment to appreciate this beautiful location unfortunate but i would give this spot a miss and find another of the many beautiful temples in bali,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya

1.0,its so commercialized its full of shops and hawkers and as a result you are being hassled to buy something every  stepsi just wanted to look at the temples and take in a peaceful atmosphere its nothing like this at all theres thousands of tourists and its more like a busy bus station than visiting hindu templesthe temples are nothing like you see on the photos online which have been heavily photoshopped theyre ok but you can see better temples on every corner in balii left feeling sad and disappointed as id wanted to see it for a long time,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
3.0,a site by the sea comprised of  average hindu temple complexes one of them turning into island at high tide above the entry gates i would say nothing thrilling thete if you have few hours free can drop by,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
4.0,this temple located at a beautiful scenery really love the beautiful surroundings you can take a beautiful picture at this areathe actual location of the temple is near the seashould not miss to visit this place if you have a chance to visit bali it take around  hours from kuta,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya

5.0,the tanah lot temple was breathtaking and beautiful the experience was great my recommendation is to visit first thing when they open  am it is not overly busy and there arent any lines to go up the temple,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
5.0,this was a visit to one of the most beautiful temples i ever visited temple in the sea no access during high tide so blissful that one can just be spiritual,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
4.0,the tanah lot park is quite big and you need to walk for a while until you arrive at the tanah lot temple itself i suggest you visit the place during low tide as youll be able to wade through the low waters towards the foot of the temple itself and get excellent photos but then again you could have amazing photos if youre still above the cliff of the park especially during sunset i highly recommend you bring water as well,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
4.0,this was my second visit as the previous ones were during weekend sunset and was overly crowded and less fun to avoid the crowd this time we made a visit during monday morning instead but guess what the place was still crowded but bearableimho this place is more beautiful during high tide as you can see the temple is surrounded by blue water while waves hit the rock of the temple this will make your photos or videos looks more beautiful and dramatic contrary to the low tide where the temple is surrounded by mud and looks less attractive,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
5.0,just beautiful the temple the view the stone work the snake in the entrance the market with fixed prices at least the one that we visited all was worth it recommended ,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
3.0,this has been said before but in order to grasp the situation and see the temple and its surrounds i had to witness it for myselfand yes whoever wrote that this venue is a huge cash cow was absolutely rightentering the carpark almost gave me a heart attack as there were so many coaches parked up it resembled a bus station  and all these coaches had people in them so that equated to many hundredsthe only way i can describe the entrance and the route to the temple would be like entering a factory outlet shopping parkthere were hawkers everywhere trying to sell cheap tat which was most off puttingwalking down to the beach area and towards the temple there was a cave which supposedly housed a holy snake but in order to see it you had to part with more money but i think i know by now what a snake looks like even a holy one at thatwalking further up the hill towards the cafe we encountered more shops selling more tat crazy really but many of the shops were selling full native american head dresses for some reasonweird thatso a word of advise  unless of course you desperately want to walk round with hoards of people  being accosted by hawkers i would suggest you read up about this temple and look at as many pictures as you can  or better still buy a video so you can experience this place in the comfort of your own armchairbut having said that i am pleased to have witnessed the hoards et all for myself and the saddest part of it all isthat you cant even get into the temple to see it,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
4.0,its a very good place to visit but the only problem is the weather which is extremly hot so it would be better to visit maybe near to sunset you cannot enter to the temple you can seeand take pictures only after seeing the temple there is a cave under the rocks where you can see the famous holy snake you can see in the picture which is very poisones and kill with one bite  people but luckely no one has ever get bitten since the snake located in this area the reason why the snake bites only the fishes for eating  however the local people have another story to tell you about this snake,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
5.0,a place to be remembered for sunset have a entrance fee but worth it a place for couple or family dont miss it,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya

4.0,if your in bali this is a must do but beware the temple  surrounds are beautiful but the crowds are enourmous like other reviews i suggest you go early in the morning as we did this time small crowds plenty of space to move around  enjoy the sights  markets,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
5.0,i can see why so many people would flock to tanah lot by night to secure that insta perfect sunset photo but i had heard that the crowds detract from this experience i opted to visit early afternoon and had a wonderful time the car park was near empty i could easily walk around the entire area at my leisure and still marvelled at the beauty well worth the visit,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
4.0,beautiful historical place will become speechless when you hear the history while looking at the surrounding view magnificent,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
5.0,everyone was right its great for sunset we arrived a bit before sunset and at low tideit was so fun to walk the sea floor and then just walk around and take photos of the sunsetpretty big complex actually tanah lot on the left and the other bedung temple on the right so maybe come late afternoon to explore the entire area then go back again to the tanah lot side for the sunset photos it gets crowded and tricky with photos but it so funsunset walking on seafloor then hearing the sea with the waves crashing and at times you wonder if it will start coming in but not really just fun theres many angles to take photos and witness the whole sea crashing into the land from the top far away then as you come closer and closer until you get to the sea floor and walk almost around the templei read that the actual temple is only for the hindus to go in and pray and that was fine the area was just funafter the sunset you can always go back up and sit and just enjoy the moment  smell the roses not everything has to be instagram perfect enjoy nature enjoy the scenery how often can you sit where it isnt too polluted you get fresh sea air and fantastic skiesv touristy before the entry to the pura complex food shops et al,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
3.0,visit this place during sunset its an amazing view with sunset as the backdrop and the waves hitting the rocks you have opportunities of capturing good photograph its too crowded during that time most of the temple is restricted and blocked going inside after certain distancethe priests there are a little greedy they will not give you the holy water until and unless you drop some money on the platesetting aside the priests behaviour its a must visit place if you plan to purchase some genuine purple rice you have paddy fields around where you could buy some small quantity depending on how much is allowed in flights,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
3.0,best visited close to sunset this small temple on a rock is surrounded by the ocean at high tide come in the late afternoon to walk around the base of the temple before the tide comes in then watch the sunset from one of the bars or beachfront restaurants nearby be aware you may not be able to enter the actual temple itself expect medium to large crowds in the evenings take  minutes to enjoy the surrounding gardens and statues too the black and white cloths and wraps around statues are holy colours,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
5.0,to be honest we werent sure what to expect on arrival here had seen plenty of photos and reviews which were mainy good however the place exceeded expectations this is a truly dramatic and inspiring place a magical must visit place,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
5.0,one of the most beautiful sunsets in the island can be seen here obviously it would be crowded honestly everywhere is bali is crowed so you cant escape thatpick a spot to sit and enjoy one of the most beautiful sunsets of the islandthe temple does not allow nonbalinese people so you can just see it from outsiderest just go for the views,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
4.0,the temple itself is no big beal but the whole area is lovely there many little stores around where locals sell their souvenirs,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
2.0,so we reached the eagerly awaited site around mid afternoon the entrance to the parking is a paid affair tickets were idr k each per adult there are a number of market stalls with reasonable prices selling everything from food to clothing all well sign posted spacious and clean then you reach the actual temple gates and this is where it gets disappointing not much to look at everything requires a donation eg to see the holy snake you pay a donation and a man removes a rock from the sand and a poor abused looking snake tries to get out from an obviously man made hole he quickly covers it up and tells you to get out there werent to many people there overall but quite a disappointing site to visit based on all the hype you read some nice views of the ocean but thats about it is it worth k per person definitely not,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya

5.0,sacred curiosity is what drew me to this temple i wondered was it as amazing as i thought it was breathtakingly beautiful even with the other sunset seekers,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
3.0,beautiful temple with lots of history around it you need a guide to make it come to life so worth investing in this i went early morning so less tourists and could see the locals going in with offerings and holding a ceremony which was a better and more authentic experience you can pay a donation to be anointed but i personally felt it intrusive although they did offer when there was clearly a big ceremony going on its still a place of worship and its something i might only have considered outside of worship times there are some great views of the coast line and you can walk quite far in low tide,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
3.0,if you want photos of the temple without  tourists lining up in front of it you need to be there no later than am we arrived quite late in the day and with the sun setting  so many people it was pretty impossible to get close upgood quality photos you can line up for photos close to the temple if you like but probably looking at hrs minimum before its your turn if you want to use a drone you have to pay extra on top of your ticket pricewould be a stunning location without the crowds so early arrival is a must,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya

4.0,this is my second visit to this temple been there few years back recently is bringing my in laws travelling  still a great place with superb scenes be careful while walking on the rocks as it is slippery and if you intend to standing on top of some rocks for photo shooting just be careful aware aware if the waves are big i witness a tourist  from china  were hit by wave and fall down from the rocks and she gets hurt however just find your own favorite spot for take pictures as its normally crowded with lots of tourists around you may walk to the temple and get blessing from the monk just put some donations and hope this place can be well maintained,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya

2.0,the view is good once you reach therehowever few issues with this place  you can go by online taxi but you cant be picked by online taxi when you wanna go  so if you come in  idr  you have to go back by local transport taxi in  idr or  sgd  they will intimidate you also and they may even chase you if they realize now you wanna go home and you may try to get online taxi by walking away from tanah lot area there are many temples in bali but similar to other temple there is no idol and everywhere its mentioned no entrance beyont this point so what you actually see is just the architecture on the building which is almost similar like chinesebuddhist temples there is a place for holy spring water where they anoint you however they are bit rigid if you want to pass by them because they want your donation in the box before they give you a flower and anoint you fool you in short there is another small place which has so called holy snake but when you go there the fake saint tells you to pay at least  idr though its not a big money but i did not have change so he dint let me see the snake lolbetter to go thailand rather bali as its only traffic  loot of your money and nothing else,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya

4.0,we came earlier than the crowded sunset times which i highly recommend we got a good parking spot and there werent too many people milling around make no mistake though  its another very touristy place but its unique enough that its worth visiting once we were there during low tide and i think it would be better to see during high tidethere was a spot where they blessed you with some water and put a few grains of rice on your head you had to do this and give a donation to enter onto the side stairs of the temple we thought youd get to climb up to the top once you got past that but what we discovered was that you could only go up a few steps once it curved around the side the rest was past a locked gateit was worth doing once but i wouldnt go again,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
3.0,the setting of this temple is really nice but unfortunately like many temples we visited it is crowded and touristy however in saying that im still glad i visited it because it is in such a beautiful setting this is a fact of life these days since instagram so we just have to grin and bear it,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya

2.0,i arranged to visit tanah lot temple after my arrival in bali on my way to ubud my driver from ubud area tours collected me as usual at the airport and off we went to tanah lot we arrived at approximately  pm on a monday with far less tourists than expectedafter wading through a sea of hawkers we eventually arrived at the look out point for tanah lot temple paid a handsome price to basically sea a black blob of rock there were security people at the entrance of the temple preventing tourists from walking around the actual site im still trying to fathom out why people are drawn to this temple and my only conclusion is that they must witness the disappointment for themselves i can be very thankful that l didnt attempt to visit at a busy sunset time as my disappointment would have been even greater a row of dirty restaurant line the area to view the temple but unless you are intending to eat or drink something you wont be welcomethankfully l had a great driver who is a fabulous registered guide at the same price as a regular driver and he described the history to me in full needless to say my overall experience of the actual temple was that its one of the biggest money spinners in bali and as long as  us  the stupid tourist keeps on coming they will keep the intrigue of getting close to the temple privatein comparison l could repeat my visits to tirta empul were they encourage tourists to embrace the temple and participate tanah lot temple is the cash cow of bali raking in millions from us the gullible tourist dont believe all the beautiful pictures you see on the internet of tanah lot it basically doesnt look like that at all,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya

1.0,we came here after finding it on trip advisor and reading all the good reviews of it the reality was not as described the temple itself is both interesting and different but as the tide was in we couldnt get that close to it i didnt mind that as its part of the location of the templemy main disappointment comes from the area around the temple which isnt in any of the photos the area around it is really really built up with tourist shops and restaurants that are there to cater to the tourist market there just so much of it that it really ruins the experience and takes away from the religious site of the temple its not even as though theyre local shops that are trying to get a bit more business they have been purposely built in the area as you have to by your entrance ticket first when wade through all the shops stalls and people trying to seek you tatthere also a cliff that would give you great views of the temple but its has been covered in restaurants and cafe who wont let you step foot up there to look at the temple unless you buy something from themi was massively disappointed and underwhelmed by tanah lot and i would tell people to save their time and money and go else where as you dont really see a lot for the price you pay,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya

4.0,interesting and must see temple leading up to it are numerous souvenir shopslined narrow streets bargaining is a mustthere are also some eateries,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
5.0,due to the timing of kecak dances and the sunset in late august i could only choose to see a beautiful sunset with dinner and drinks overlooking the waters or go see the local kecak dance unfortunately doing both is not really an option since kecak happens at sunset heres a breakdown of the best options for boththere are two kecak dance performance sites in tanah lot though only one of them is heavily advertised at the gate and around the temple pm de jukung resto  bar  hour show k idrwhen you enter tanah lot from the parking gate this is the kecak show they offer a ticket on sale for when you enter you could technically see a tiny bit of the sunset while watching the kecak dance if you sit on the higher levels of the amphitheater and then have a really great dinner at de jukung resto afterward unfortunately this location is not currently listed on apple maps so rely on google maps and asking locals how to get there instead its about a min walk through tourists from the temple pm dewi sinta hotel  min show k idrthis is your best chance to catch most of the sunset views around tanah lot in august and see a kecak dance show in the same evening this location is listed on apple maps and google maps and is actually much closer to the temple since its just up the street about a  min walk through tourists from the templei unfortunately did not get to see either of these kecak dance shows because it was my first visit and i wanted to walk around more but i did get to see quite a few great sunset watching spots and heres a breakdown of those sunset from wahrung sunset bagus  relaxed drinks with cliffside temple viewsthis is the closest sunset temple view for relaxing with drinks and westernlike foods there are fewer umbrellas here which make it easier to see great skies no matter where you sit service is relaxed at best so dont expect people to check on you just call them when you need them they prefer to leave you alone unless you need something this doesnt show up on apple maps but does appear on google maps from the temple you walk through a small market alley to the right until you get to the cliffside cafes people start to claim their sunset cliffside tables around pm sunset from tanah lot beach  trump golf course  natural views with less peoplegoogle maps lists this area as tanah lot beach apple maps listed this area as trump golf course to access the beach and walking paths go to the end of the sunset cafe area mentioned above around a small red gate through a little patch of wood and then onto a paved path that leads to open beach and a great overlook that provides views of the sun setting directly behind tanah lot this is an amazing spot for photographers and instagrammers to get iconic sunset shots with tanah lot in the background but lots of open beach in the foreground a lot of people start to claim sunset watching spots here around pmalternative sunset locations with secondary viewsif you feel like youve seen enough of tanah lots main temple during the day and want a different sunset view check out these options sunset on batu bolong temple  thread the sunset through the holeas i was walking through the park to the north of the main tanah lot temple i wondered why so many people were camping out along the side of the cliff then i realized that it would be pretty spectacular to watch the sunset through the natural bridge under batu bolong temple the view from above wouldnt provide a complete sunset under the bridge but if youre on the ground at the right time of year you might be able to accomplish it from the beach level if you can get down there when the tide is low enough sunset at de jukung resto  bar  relaxing indonesian dinner at sunsetthis option does not give you sunset views of any of the temples but it does give you  sunset views over the open waters with a really great indonesian and seafood meal we could hear a little bit of the kecak dance happening at the nearby arena from our table even though we couldnt see it there was also a private event happening for the major sports teams of indonesia while we were there so there were a lot of people around but the service was still very attentive for dealing with food allergies and the quality was excellentwas this review helpful,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya

4.0,we first went to tanah lot in the s a lot has changed there would have been less than  people there these days s the temple and surrounds are really beautiful and you really dont regret going there even with the heat and the crowds we were there around midday would definitely recommend either early morning or evening,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya

5.0,i went in the morning at high tide and people recommend the evening for low tide but it was still stunning nonetheless a bonus about being there in the morning was the cool weather and way fewer people its definitely worth the short drive from ubud,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
5.0,yes its busy but there is still room to move around and doesnt ruin the experience we all add to the congestion by being therewe had about  hours before sunset and walked to the nearest temple first its not a long walk but you get he views to the south east and if you carry on towards the restaurant there are steps that lead part way down to the beach but is blocked  again you can get close to waveswe then followed path back up to where the cliff point is snake charmer land and saw tanah lot temple from above it is amazing how it stands on its own i can imagine its better with tide in as the waves break against the templewe walked down yes crowded but lots of space  maybe not for the instagrammers who want it all for themselves the waves are very strong and unpredictable but nice to spend  mins there watching the waves and tanah lot close upwe then waited for sunset and there are many places to do this aside from the spectacular sunset the other great phenomenon was the s of birds that suddenly appeared as the sun hit the horizon i assume this is a daily thinganyway definitely a must see and just go with the expectation that others want to enjoy also and you wont be disappointed,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya

4.0,as with uluwatu it had been  years since we visited this temple site and we were astounded with the rampant commercialism of the entire area surrounding the temple still stands in splendid isolation atop the outcrop the waves and high tides providing some semblance of barriers to the hordes trying to get access the extensive onshore commercial area also includes a number of shrines intermixed among the restaurants shops and art market stalls easier to see pekendungan temple batu mejan temple batu bolong temple jro kandang temple and enjung galuh temple the map provided when we purchased our tickets is a user friendly plan of the complex we arrived at am approx after a two hour drive from kuta square but the throngs were already present we were lucky to have an excellent driverguide who interacted with officials and stall holders on our behalf and ensured that no ripoffs occurred despite the crowds and commercialism i still reckon that tanah lot is a must see at least once if visiting bali,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya
3.0,tanah lot itself is very picturesque and it is easy to spend a few hours there as there is a small beach with rocks to climb and a market full of the usual bali trinketsmy problem though is with getting out using any of the online ride share transports there is a cartel running among the taxi drivers so we were advised to walk away from the temple area and call a car from there however when we did this and the car arrived it was blocked by someone and not allowed to leave a london cabbie would have just pulled away but my driver was young and didnt want any trouble after i had a stand up row with the official blocking the way we were still not moving so i instructed the car to drive on without us and we walked a few km out of the villagei was warned but hoped that we could get away with it all the local businesses are in on the racket we we dobbed in by a restaurant owner who saw us waitingbali is fantastic but if they want to move their tourist industry on then they have to sort out the transport situation and accept that online cans are now a fact,Tanah Lot Temple,Bali,Budaya

3.0,went to the buffet and free flow alcohol up on the third floor it was low season so still spare tables at about pm food was quite a large spread at least a dozen different things pastas indonesian meals fried chicken noodle dish pork skewers etc salad ingredients free flow alcohol was good no lines  drink per person but you could keep going back drinks were limited types prost beer drum whiskey empire gin and a vodka music was really pretty good the whole night the whiskey was really weird though my wife had half a glass but couldnt finish it it tasted really really weird a cpl hours later we went down to the night club on lvl  which was pretty quite but music was good she started throwing up dont think it was food no stomach upset think it might have been methanol poisoning from the drink the local whiskey in the morning after throwing up another  or  times overnight no problems so overall the whole thing was very good value easily got our rk  taxes actually rk worth dinner and about  or  drinks for me but wife getting sick made it a bad end to the night,LXXY Bali,Bali,Urban

4.0,we gave this place two visits on our trip to bali  its cheaper than skygarden and doesnt have the line up for drinkspositives price  you cant go past this for free flow drinks even if you dont eat reasonably quick service at the bar which meant that the queues for drinks were not bad at all great vista  very open which also means you arent overpowered by smokerswhilst my partner loved the food i was a bit disappointed apparently the chef was on holidays so things were not quite up to the standards usually there so i will go back and try it again but for me the food was quite bland and there were not enough options for people with allergies also the set up leaves a lot to be desiredthe food ran out with alarming consistency the whole night so there was a rush each time it was out out not enough serving implements tongs meant people had their hands all over the food  also people are smoking whilst getting their meals  my partner had to point out to a lady that her cigarette ash fell into one of the serving dishes the tom yam soup was way too spicy  we could not eat it and we are used to spice lack of vegetables here also to be used in the soup basedessert  ice cream you serve yourself out of a tub it was nice ice cream but really should be in the small individual servings size more options needed here toooverall a nice alternative to skygarden but lacks on the food side of things,LXXY Bali,Bali,Urban

3.0,i visited the web site  filled in the details for a booking of  people did not receive any acknowledgement of bookingnor were the staff aware when our group arrivedthe bad arriving at opening time surprised to see the staff still setting up the food we tried the precooked potatos rice and pad thai the food was quite tasty but only slightly warm this was  minutes after opening our bbq food orders number  took more than  minutes to arrive the staff apologised but said they had trouble firing up the bbqthe pizza was luke warmbar the first and each subsequent beer was barely cold certainly not a level of cold for what most tourists would expect serving  staff stood around doing little but only one barman weirdthe lack of atmosphere was actually quite strange this place should be packedthe good the staff are very friendly the food is actually quite tasty  but cold the price is excellent the venue has improved significantly since its opening much more user friendlyoverall  despite the ridiculous delays for our bbq despite the lukewarm food and lukewarm beerour group had an enjoyable eveningthe value is questionablethe obvious alternative is skygardenon price lxxy is cheaper the service is poorer the food is much lower standard and far less variery the beer is warmits a different venue so difficult to comparehowever if the management actually put some effort in lxxy could be a viable alternativeas a local resident that has international and local visitors every week at the moment i cant see myself taking or recommending lxxy to my visiting friendsafter one year between visits i can only say how disappointed i am with this venue,LXXY Bali,Bali,Urban

1.0,buffet food was not fresh and was cold it looked like they were serving food from the previous day the food serving area looked dirty and outdated all you can drink is a fallacy they only serve one beer if you are a beer person avoid this place like the plague you have been warned skygarden is  times better,LXXY Bali,Bali,Urban

1.0,we went to sky garden following the advice of the lonely planet travel guide and found that it was shut a local said it was due to them not paying taxes disappointed we missed out sounds like it used to be great fun,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
5.0,food really really good at this place good selection of food from the buffet hope to come here again,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
4.0,we enjoyed a lot most of the nights we were there like almost every night while we were in bali we felt safe because of the presence of the guards however it wasnt that safe after all  of my friends lost their phones on the same night last year when we were on the dance floor one of our friends lost her iphone we thought at that time that it was an isolated case however this year  of my friends lost their phones and theyre not drunk yet so it wasnt that fun for that particular night,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
5.0,ready to experience the real bali nightlifevisit this famous bali nightclub since day theres a lot of good music and placce to dance,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
3.0,it became expensive all different stages playing same kind of music with a space like this could have proper djs palying unstead of that edm style that the tracks are all the same from dj to dj definitly there are better options in bali,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
3.0,the place could have been better if less crowded it was full of people and i felt suffocating at many times lastly i left the place in just  mins,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
5.0,so if you are in bali and want to party like crazy with good music and crowd this is the place to be  you will surely love it  the place is havoc have different themes of dance floor  the best one is right at st floor the open deck near dj  thats where the best music is playedwe were there till  am in morning dancing like crazy,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
5.0,one of the best and famous to spend your night is sky garden the place where you and friends can listen the music from top dj from whole over the worldhave your drink and enjoy ,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
5.0,we visited the skygarden in the rain and although initially the outside terrace was closed off due to the rain the shear vastness of the gardens set over several levels with bars cafes and drink or photo opportunities is something to be seenyou have to prebook your visit online to be guaranteed entry although there are walk up places but you have to que on first come basiswe enjoyed our visit extremely and plan to go again hopefully next time with better weather to see even further,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
5.0,my friend and i  came here two nights both night were fantastic the top floor plays the best music and the security team are phenomenal i felt safer their then i do at home excellent vibe with everyone having a dance be prepared to get sweaty as youre dancing up a storm though,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
5.0,enterence fee here bit expensive  but we never wrong to pay it for best club in bali  enjoy the party  hope see back again,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
5.0,i was on a honeymoon at bali we made our way to sky garden kuta such a classy place we both a blast i had lost my fone i was in such a panic state we were having a good time this had literally put me off we approached the lost  found i got my fone the employee sent it straight to the lost and found and rest was a crazy evening there it was my first experience at bali kuta i had one of the best times evr,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
4.0,we  girls were here for our th bday bash and we really enjoyed it cocktails were very cheap and shisha was super cheap as well we were quite late for the buffet they were wrapping it up but music was great and food was quite good too,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
1.0,honestly i didnt even bother going in to this joint they want you to pay  just to go in when everything else around is free all the crew i spoke to that went there said it was just full off hookers and loud music  like everything else around for freenext,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
1.0,just rip off unfortunately even if you like to speak to supervisor  manager at  no one there and issue cant be sortedit was a good place few years ago now just mess and high pricing without any competence  sad but truejust choose other places around ,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
5.0,i cant explain how crazy good of a deal this place is i dont often get exited about going somewhere but after going here the first time i just could not wait to go back the second night you pay in i think its k tax so about k and thats for unlimited beer spirits alchopops and more but not only that theres a huge buffet and the food is really good like some of the better buffet food ive ever ate they have different specialtys every night but still keep a section for food like burgers chicken ribs ect just amazing you can go up and get  drinks at a time so it really does feel like theres a catch to it when your sitting with a plate full of food and  beers just after being in there  mins but theres not i did take full advantage after food i must of had about  beers between  and even if i was buying cheap beer from the stores outside this is still  cheaper and you get food and a nice place to sit i would say tho that come  the que for the drinks gets ridicules like about a  min wait for anything so id advise get there at  and enjoy the night before its too packed,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
5.0,one of the best places yo spend the night they offer good drinks shisha and cocktails its very safe the security guards are everywhere and always asking if youre okay or not,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
3.0,for a monday it was surprisingly fun however the food has left me and my friend in an unexplainable amount of pain maybe we should have realized eating free steak in a night club was a bad idea but it felt right at the time i warn u do not fall into the trap we are about to board a plane and are scouting out puke bags still fun tho ,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
5.0,my partner and i had so much fun really chilled with what you wear and drinks were decently priced only thing that is a bit weird is females are free but males have to pay other then that it was the funnest night of my life,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
4.0,huge discotheque mostly crowded with caucasian wearing casual clothings and sandals for parties youll be spoilt with pole dancers in other section rb in another section etc generous and good serving of buffet which come with the entrance fees and  bottle of beers the quality of food and desserts were as good as a  star restaurant the dancers at the stage were great to watch though,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
2.0,its changed alot at the door for  people i paid mil indr and you get one free drink the prices are much too high,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
5.0,pay k for ulimited foods till pm and any alcohol drinks till pm young people around  peoples and its just at the beginning of evening very recommend                ,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
1.0,i have been to sky garden several times in the last  years i knew all the managers and staff it was a great place excpet the fact that has been always friendly to local prostitutesbut now the ower changed and you dont just have many prostitutes the new chinese ower plays dirty scams like closing the line for unlimited drinks earlier or explicity asking the staff to serve drinks very slowly the unlimbeted buffet and drinks has been the best deal for years but now its just a scam with the new owneravoid skygarden several foreigners has been robbed also as you can read in many reviews just go to canggu much better people atmosphere and staff,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
5.0,the tracks played by australian djs are pulsating and lively there are different floors for different types of music food spread is also very nicegood place to let your hair down,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
2.0,after having researched top clubs in bali we chose to head to sky garden in our first night firstly the traffic jam on the street is unbelievable secondly the walk upto the top level is difficult esp for women in heels this was one of the few clubs that insist on a cover charge and all you get for  is a single glass of wine as you enter the first level has some dj playing with a large scree display in background noone is on the floor even though its packed with local youngsters we make our way to the top level where the music is better and so is the crowd somehow for some strange reason the bar serves unlimited buffet to everyone so there is a serpentine queue that unnecessarily crowds the already crowded area the buffet consists of  items that are deep fried after taking the plate you will realise there is no place to sit to eat so all you want to do is get rid of that plate and just try and enjoy the musicthe place looks ordinary with hardly any decor most crowd is local and college going finally you realise you cant take it anymore and walk down three levels and then sit in a can that takes another half an hour to get out of the lane highly avoidable,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
4.0,been here on feb  celebrate my husband bday entry fee about a  each we can eat all you can mostly western restaurant located at roof top good ambiance if you can be there before sunset bit crowdednext visit about aug  restaurant move bit inside menu less than before not really interesting but still love free drinks light alcoholsif you like clubbing maybe suitable place for you sound well managed not mixed in between floori preference live music with jazz and blue genre unfortunately cant get from this place overall good option for traveler,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
5.0,this is one of those iconic places which is a much visit if i was younger i would be there every day heaps of party people entertainment food is great i love the roof top to chill and people watch,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
3.0,very large place with  idrs with food and beer for  hours incredibly cheap unfortunately too many people get drunk and become very annoying with  hours to drink beer for free definitely a place for the younger ones,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
1.0,visited  nights in a row friends were robbed inside seriously if the staff and management are not doing anything about it we all need to avoid and patron other placesvery dissapointed,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban

5.0,good music from all genres i was expecting bollywood songs as welldjs choice is really nice do not miss the dance by performers expensive but worth it,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban
4.0,skygarden is probably one of my favorite clubs in bali this is the perfect place to have fun with my friendsalthough the staff and security could be annoying sometimes the music is just my style starting off with idr k all you can eat buffet heating off at the rooftop and end the night at the skydome sounds like a perfect way to spend your weekendps ladies do not depend on the ladies free entry pm too much p,Sky Garden,Bali,Urban

5.0,as we have visited bali safari so many times we decided to give this one a go it is smaller in comparison and yes the african section is still under constructionthis zoo is pram friendly but getting in and out the shuttle bus to get to the sumatran section will require you to fold and unfold the pramsome steep ramps but they are manageableanimals are quite close and you can take good photos some nice restaurants with decent choice of foods we had lunch at the restaurant near the elephant ride they had some cultural performance and photo opp with snakes and gibbons at lunch timenice  degree view from the rooftop above the ice cream place perfect for selfiesthis zoo is missing some big animals like giraffe hippo and rhino but the rest of them are there and very visible you can also feed the lions which looks quite interestingthe animal shows are not as fun as the bali safari but they suit younger kids moreoverall we spent around  hours in the zoo and we managed to see all the animals it was a good day out for us,Bali Zoo,Bali,Urban

2.0,firstly the  rupiah entry is a bit steep for whats on show particularly when you find half the place is under construction this means no lions giraffes rhinos zebras etc being indonesia i really wanted to see a komodo dragon these magnificent creatures grow to around m in the wild the zoo has  babies m each that donr really cut it indonesia means orang utans too but again only a couple of babies playing outside i was told the rest are inside to limit their contact with humans pretty daft when you consider they are forced to have breakfast with the humans every day elephants too lining up like taxis to give rides to whoever will pay for them im sure the zoo will be better in future but while all the construction is going on i can only rate it poor value for money,Bali Zoo,Bali,Urban
2.0,firstly pretty expensive entrance  rupiah per adult half the zoo is still under construction so will probably be better in a coupe of years however reviewing now  jan   there is only a poor selection of animals on show being indonesia i wanted to see a komodo dragon these magnificent creatures grow up to m in length the ones in the zoo are about m babies and hardly what i was hoping for also indonesian means orang utans but again they were in hiding after being forced to have breakfast with the humans i was told the reason not on view was to limit their time with human contact not good also elephants lining up like taxis offering rides to anyone who wants to pay the extra all in all cmopared to other zoos poor value for money at the moment,Bali Zoo,Bali,Urban

5.0,we deliberated on whether to do bali zoo or bali safari all the drivers were recommending bali safari we wanted to experience mud fun with the elephants and this can only be done at bali zoo being a veterinary nurse i was really concerned over animal welfare but other reviews of the zoo were very positive we suspect you can see more animals at safari but we can do that in melbourne we wanted a unique encounter that can apparently only be done at bali zoo and in thailand for the cost it was definately value for money and was an absolute highlight the zoo itself is undergoing renovations but the facilties are very good quality our personal transport was on time and definately worth going early am pckup as no traffic and a bit cooler we had some morning tea before our mahoot kris had us prepare our elephant hatis food we were introduced and spent  minutes feeding her and patting her we then went into the shallow pool and got ourselves mudded up before spending half an hour coating her body with mud as mahout alex kept her happy and lying down once her beauty treatment was finished we showered with her and brushed her down we then went into the deeper pool and got to play in the water we were provided showers and towels afterwards the photographer took over  photos and as we ate our included brunch they let us view the photos the photo package we chose was around  but we got  printed and rather large photos and the rest on digital what a magical experience we then went on our own around the zoo the food options are good but on the expensive side for bali but who cares when you see where the money goes lots of animals about for interaction including a python and siamang for photos and the kids got a kick out of swinging some chicken out to the lions to snack on the savannah is under construction which will be amazing and its nice to see that bali is finally taking on board animal welfare issues,Bali Zoo,Bali,Urban

5.0,we have been to a few nights at the zoos in other countries and had a rough idea of what to expect first impression when arriving at the zoo was great the lively colourful mural on the way was wonderful and a great photo opportunity we were given information on what to expect and even plastic ponchos as it look like there might be a rain shower fortunately this did not occur on entering the zoo you walk amongst deer which are roaming freely for children and adults alike this was a fun way to start our encounters plenty of hand sanitation points were to be found and the guide had extra also feeding was arranged and everybody had a chance to do this as the groups were small  groups of around roughly  people walking through the zoo it is apparent it is undergoing some redevelopment but it did not detract from the night time visit not sure how it affects day visitors the two group were separated by around  mins so you do not get distracted by foreseeing what the group in front had seen or was doing there are wallabies in the same area as the deer and all seemed relaxed with people surrounding them as we wandered through to see the lions we walked through an area where you could be photographed with a snake an owl and a pangolin the lions den was next and one pride was out and being fed by the keeper they were so close and active obviously it was amazing dinner was next  oh no but i dont need to eat im here to see the animals as we went in i noticed it was buffet and thought ill find something to be honest the food was so good i would consider going back just for that there was something for everyone vegetarians vegans fish and meat eater with lions parading in front of your window amongst some of the food i tried i had salt and pepper squid some of the best i have had the lions are separated from the restaurant by thick plate glass and walk back and front along it no doubt enticed by the smell of us and the food after dinner it was on to a small double decker bus top deck please and a short drive to feed the elephants there was more than enough for adults and children alike to feel they all had fed the elephants again plenty of sanitation available short stop later out to have a photo opportunity of feeding different elephants out of the bus great fun to do and watch others antics also we say the porcupine and were given a brief bit of information about him and the zoos conservation efforts the final stop was the tiger house where after a short information brief we were shown and watched the keeper feed the tiger it did feel slightly like a circus act and i appreciate why he made him stand for the food but it did not sit comfortably the evening finished with a short exhibition of the fire dancers which was a wonderful spectacle but not sure why it was included other than for cultural aspects thanks you to dedex who looked after us for dinner and compliments to the chef loved your food ayumi who guided us through and answered our questions was lovelyon the whole it was a very well organized evening and a fun night for two adults the only thing i would say is we found out about the great conservation work and success the zoo is having by asking questions i felt as though it was a little secret that was being kept and would be released at a later date you are a young zoo and should share this information with your visitors as some people are happy and willing to sponsor animals etc,Bali Zoo,Bali,Urban
5.0,early morning trip to the zoo cut out the worst of the traffic entry is smooth and modern the elephants come on first and there are plenty of opportunities for a good picture and feeding of elephants there were two orangutans who were happy to pose for the cameras and ample opportunities for a personal picture breakfast was plentifultiger enclosure was very well done saw plenty of animals good for kids as there is a water playground for them and numerous food outlets,Bali Zoo,Bali,Urban

5.0,early  pickup as we were staying in nuda dua  which along with the return journey was organised by the zoo arrived in plenty of time checked in at zoo entrance a small walk and then transported to the area by shuttle bus shown to our designated table with around another  people then helped ourself to a fantastic buffet breakfast as a couple of elephants arrived closely followed by a couple of orangutan which came swinging in along a line of connected ropes to a couple of platforms amongst the breakfast area to enjoy there vegetarian breakfast whilst we eat ours then there was plenary of opportunity and time to have plenty of photos with the orangutan  dont have your sunglasses or any hats on or they are fair game  there is also photo opportunities with the elephants and some parakeets  do take your own camera as the keepers will take photos for you you also had chance to watch a couple of elephants take a early morning dip with there keepers in the large water hole well worth the money and well organised all the animals seemed to be happy probably cause they was also being feed lolwe also added the elephant mud bath to our day,Bali Zoo,Bali,Urban

1.0,extremely overpriced for what you get half of the zoo is under construction and there are very few animals to see as expected food and drinks inside the zoo are also overpriced and the quality is nothing special perhaps once they finish all the renovations it might be a more interesting place to visit but until then its not worth the  entrance fee,Bali Zoo,Bali,Urban
4.0,the zoo was organize properly the have few animal show make sure to check the show time upfront from their websiteticket price bit expensive not much activity can be done here beside sightseeing and see the animals you may ride with the elephant if you like it it come with seperate packagethere are few restaurants  gift shop inside the zoo they have splash water pool also good for childrenyou may spend    hours inside the zoo depending on activities you do since our kids not really enjoy the trip we just spend around  hours inside here,Bali Zoo,Bali,Urban
3.0,id say its good for kids definitely worth doing the elephant side first then the remaining zoo as the excitement does die down still nicely maintained when we went a lot of it was closed for maintenance but we got to see a lot of different animals too,Bali Zoo,Bali,Urban
5.0,when we booked this experience we were a little apprehensive about what we would see having heard and read horror stories about animal care and exploitation in tourism we were very pleasantly surprised by bali zoo the animals look healthy happy well cared for and loved the moment that drove home this point was when one of the orangutans a cheeky  year old female clearly behaved like she was not in the mood to sit on her platform and have her photo taken instead of chaining her or otherwise forcing her to stay the staff apologized and said they would not make any of their animals do anything that they dont want to do this for us was a huge plus rather than a negative while we wanted to see them it was more important to us that they were treated humanelythe breakfast itself was fantastically delicious with an immense variety of food and the staff was attentive friendly and efficient our server kuz did not skip a beat making sure we had everything we wanted and more the manager of the program gung tra also came over to personally inquire how we were enjoying the experience i would recommend this zoo to anyone visiting bali,Bali Zoo,Bali,Urban

4.0,we went to bali zoo near ubud to swim with elephants where else in the world could you do this ok theres one other zoo in malaysia i think but this is really a once in a lifetime experience the cost of the experience is au but for this kind of unique experience that is pretty cheap we thought you enter the zoo and walk past some deer wallabies and quakkers to a shuttle bus this takes you past the orangutans enclosure with clear views of the these cute apes you then catch another ride on a golf buggy which is a bit of a hairy roller coaster of a ride a short walk takes you to the elephant area this is a small clearing with some tables scattered about and a small spread of food included in the price the guide tells you some rules such as do not punch the elephant then they bring out some bananas carrots and pumpkins and a clever and get guests to chop them up we then went over to the majestic beasts in three groups we were allocated an elephant called adelle we fed her the veges and then she was lead into a mud pool and she lay down we were then able to go in and cover her and ourselves in mud which was messy but fun she was then lead out to a shower where we scrubbed her with brushes finally we went into a pool where adelle crouched down and we washed off the last of the mud and patplayed with her they took photos of us with our elephant and then we said goodbye and went and showered ourselves this was followed by a complimentary buffet lunch afterwards we were able to purchase our photos but were horrified by the price  aud for one photo and this was the cheapest option they allow you to take photos when feeding the elephants but then a mobiles go in a plastic tub and are taken away this is an external company too  none if the money goes back to the zoo so youre kind of railroaded into forking out another large sum to have a photo of this unforgettable experience this was the only down side to what was otherwise a fabulous experience highly recommended,Bali Zoo,Bali,Urban

3.0,seminyak is lively vibrant and based north of dempasar airport it is a goto destination for australians to party be loud and scream wowo when a song they like is playedbefore arrival i would recommend downloading this offline mapmeit will allow you to find locations suggest routes and direct you to locations without the need for international roaming or access to mobile dataseven maximum days is probably all you need in seminyakwhen booking your accommodation check that there are no building works or renovations planned for your residence or the adjoining properties if so ensure that they price the accommodation accordingly or compensate you in other waysyou should never go anywhere without local currency however i would suggest that you only get a small amount before you arrive there are a number of reputable money changers in seminyak and the exchange rates are considerably better locally and without commissionhowever check the rate that is advertised is the rate that you are getting ensure that the teller counts the money out and then steps away from the money allowing you to pick it up yourself to count it watch for the slight of hand as they count out your money watch for slight of hand as they replace your money with damaged or torn money and watch out for different rates for different denominations of currencywhen you exit the airport you will be confronted with taxi drivers wanting to take you to your destination if you choose to use one of these drivers it is important to arrange the price before beginning your journey with themthe journey from the airport should cost no more than  rupees as an upper limit normally charged by hotels return journeys should be considerably less and should be negotiated in the hours before your departure for the airportthe journey to and from the airport under normal circumstances should take about  minutes however the government is building an underpass at a critical junction near the airport and it now takes from fortyfive minutes up to an hour and a half these roadworks are likely to take up to one year to complete at the time of this articlebluebird taxis are the official metered taxis and if you wish to avoid bartering you should take one of these however be aware of other taxis that also paint their cars blue that do not have a meter if you use an unmetered taxi be sure to negotiate a price prior to setting outthere is a public bus service that runs every half an hour from seminyak square that will take you to a number of locations prices for each one way ticket on various lines that go to and from a main hub vary from  to  rupeesnone of the prices advertised in shops bars massage parlours and restaurants include the  government tax and  service charge you should always consider these additional amounts when gauging the price of your purchaseseminyak is not cheap cocktails ate around  rupees and bingtang beer is between  and  fanta is  crisps are between  and  breakfast menus are around   grams of pork ribs is  and a whole roasted pig is million massages are very reasonably priced and can cost  rupees for one houralways check that the amount that you are being charged for drinks meals and goods are the same amount that are being advertised on the menuyou should budget for about  per day between food drinks activities and taxisif you wish to hire a van to take you to jimbaran wait for  hours while you enjoy the beach and get some seafood and bring you back this will cost between  and  rupeeswork under the assumption that all prices are suggestions and that negotiations are a part of everyday businessa lot of plastic rubbish washes up on the beaches of seminyak so you will see groups of volunteers clearing the beaches as you go for your morning walkthe beach has no shade and the sun and humidity become oppressive after am so get your morning exercise in early or wait until the sun goes down in the eveningthere are a lot of stray dogs on the beach and roads generally they are harmless however they can turn aggressive very quickly so either walk with a stick on the beach or back away very slowly maintaining eye contact if you are confrontedif you are unfortunate enough to get sick and require medical or hospital attention there are a few things of which you should be awarealways have the details of your travel medical insurance provider about your person either in your phone purse or walletno hospital or medical facility will admit you without knowing how the bill will be paid often you will be required to provide a credit card until you can identify your travel medical insurance provider and the coverage it providesknow your excess liability on your policy and ensure that is the only amount that you pay when you are being dischargedhospitals have been known to say that your medical insurance only covers so much of the treatment and that you have to pay as much as an additional  this is where having your medical insurance provider on speed dial is useful to clarify any misunderstandingseven once the correct excess has been identified look out for the further slight of hand as your excess may be increased by  or more due to exchange rate differences or administration costs stand your ground the only out of pocket expense that you should pay is the exact amount of the excess on your policywhen you are returning back at the airport you must have access to your boarding pass in order to get into the checkin area this can be electronic or paper but the guards to the checkin area will require sight of the flight number date and time of the flights along with your name this seems to be an increasing protocol across a lot of asian countriesit is best to download these before you get to the airport as wifi access at the airport dose not appear to cater for downloading boarding passes or emailsthese are ml liquid checks at the gates before boarding the plane throughout asian airports so drink your water or throw it away and ask about your duty free allocation coming in and leavingif you watch out for these pitfalls you will have a great time in seminyak the people are friendly and everyone is looking out for an opportunityenjoy,Seminyak Square,Bali,Urban

3.0,seminyak is probably the best place to go in bali if you want nightlife and a busy atmosphere if you want chilled out scenic luxury seminyak isnt the place for you seminyak square is lined with quite good bars all with live entertainment which is very good and all with friendly staff and has a good choice of restaurants if there is a restaurant you would require to dine in i would advise booking in advance as everywhere can get quite busy on an evening there are road patrols to help you cross the road as the traffic of cars and scooters get quite crazy and could be potentially dangerous my tips would be always check with your taxi before getting in how much the fare will be and agree on price the best taxis to use are the bluebird ones also watch your bags and pockets and dont walk along quiet roads alone after dark,Seminyak Square,Bali,Urban

4.0,plenty of shopping and lots of restaurants the shops are mainly high end surf clothing and beach style stores billabong surfer girl that sort of stuff we enjoyed walking around for a couple of hours but there wasnt anything worth going there for if youre not staying in a nusa dua resort its just a nice place to shop around if you want to escape a hotel youre staying at nearby,Bali Collection,Bali,Urban

4.0,had many restaurants optionshopping venuesreasonable price compare to nusa dua areawe have lunch here,Bali Collection,Bali,Urban
2.0,they sell whiteningbleaching content so be careful of what you pick up also some places i feel they treated us like a criminal due to whatever stereotypes they are accustomed to buying into they clearly dont encourage minorities that are darker or mixed to shop in the area they also dont carry sizes for people like my boyfriend who have larger feet for example there is clearly a target audience and it was uncomfortable to say the least plus they practice cultural appropriation with the braiding despite the hairstyle is black and more for those of african decent yes if you have this in your hair and youre not black you are wrong they are again appealing to a target audience that isnt us there also isnt very many places to shop in my opinion especially for jewelry the restaurants are worth it though so we mainly went for lunch they are also very pushy to sell you everything and anything if you want something to get for souvenirs id say go to the museums or cultural park in the area instead to get more ideal things the supermarket there is good for if you left a few things or need something like pads or soap for example just be wary if youre black and get in and get out,Bali Collection,Bali,Urban

3.0,standard open air shopping mall with live music playing in certain sections if staying in nusa dua it is worth a visit otherwise it is not worth a visit has convenience store pharmacy and souvenir shops with a nice mix of restaurants,Bali Collection,Bali,Urban
2.0,what is the most important thing for us is safety so we always try to travel in bali by the state taxi so when you travel back to the hotel try to use blue taxis blue bird or find out maybe there is a shuttle service from your hotel when you are at the territory dont buy something in a rush go and look at the prices as we had quite an unpleasant experience at the padi art market stall there the goods there are often in dust quite dirty as it is not in the building we bought some things there and one of them was a wicker basket ten minutes later we found exactly the same in a good store sogo the price was two times less than in padi plus it was a clean one so we went to the padi art market and asked them to return our money as it is technically possible if you have a receipt and  days have not passed since the moment of purchase i want readers to understand that we just dont like being cheated on a cashier i believe her name was like jenny or something said that the goods bought in their store cant be returnable ok but there was not a sign about it in the shop usually in legal shops and in bali collection too they write  please look carefully at the purchase as it is not returnable but in this shop there was nothing about it i can recommend only sogo department store as it is a clean one and the choice of goods is really great the staff are very helpful there are often discounts on many items,Bali Collection,Bali,Urban

4.0,on our last day to bali and some cash left we visited bali collection nusa dua definitely worth a visit one or two shops note worthy had lunch at the italian restaurant which had great and reasonably priced pizzadefinitely managed to spend all our cash,Bali Collection,Bali,Urban
3.0,in my opinion the bali collection is a collection of overpriced stores for tourists it doesnt genuinely feel like you are in bali when you visit i wouldnt go back,Bali Collection,Bali,Urban
4.0,i wasnt expecting much after reading other reviews of this place but it was actually quite nice had some nice places to eat much cheaper than our hotel and was very clean and quite relaxing some nice places to have a coffee and get more healthy food than the hotel offered too our daughter got her hair braided while we had a massage at the same place and when we were riding the bikes we hired she asked if we could go back here so she could get another icecreammost of the shops were aussie surf shops charging aussie prices it seemed but that said if you needed something good to be able to get it and there is also a pharmacy etc and small grocery shopthe sogo department store actually had some interesting stuff and different brandsproducts and some things werent badly priced either so we bought a few things also bought a few things at one of the souvenir shops and even though we no doubt paid much more than some could have bought the same things elsewhere the lack of hassle and a fixed price actually suited usi wouldnt go out of my way to come here from other places but if youre staying in the area its a nice option to try some different food and have a relaxed browse of some shops,Bali Collection,Bali,Urban
2.0,overpriced and boring shops better off traveling to local marketsyou will pay inflated prices and find anything you can get for a better price at home the supermarket is extremely expensive too so it better to get outside and visit a local supermarket for necessities,Bali Collection,Bali,Urban
5.0,we spent around three hours in this place eating and shopping you may get annoyed from the restuarant staff asking you to dine in overall experience is good,Bali Collection,Bali,Urban
4.0,this is an open air shopping centre in nusa dua it is not an outlet the prices in some of the shops are western prices so no great bargains to be had however it is a nice place and it is very easy to spend a few hours in the place which has some nice restaurants to eat in,Bali Collection,Bali,Urban
1.0,dont go in the rainy season some operators will still sell you the tour on the streets and say its possible that this is a lie but please dont trust them the weather is far too unpredictable and there are frequent landslides when theres a lot of rainfall those operators just want to make money and unfortunately dont care about your safetyecological impact while the park is officially closed must be beautiful and amazing to visit in the dry season though,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,so you are thinking about climbing this mountain and deciding if this is a good way to spend your time in lombok well you should definitely do this trekthere are so many reasons for it i will give you what you need to hear onlyfirst of all this mountain is gorgeous and majestic it offers something you wont see everyday or even yearly if you want to go here to spend with your family or partner or even friends this is a perfect place to do that of course you have to be fitthe most important part to get the most out of this experience is a great trekking organizer there are so many out there and you are wondering which to choose let me save you time from headache rinjni fundtin from countless hours of researching and battled with my perfectionist personality i can proudly recommend that to you all i will comeback to tackle the summit this june with them and they offers summit trek start from april i was lucky to have seats with them on june as they almost fully booked,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,mount rinjani is a beast but worth itthe views from the campsites and the summit are awesome this is what makes the hike worth it the lake looks stunning in the crater below but be preparedwe read many reviews saying it was extremely hard however none of them prepared us for the summit now we are relatively fit  year olds so thought we could tackle anything which we did but with difficulty what makes it so hard is the sand like ground you are walking up at a very steep gradient so every two steps you take forward is the equivalent to just one its also freezingwe went with cakrawala due to its great reviews and they didnt disappoint mr sultan was great at organising everything and his guides and porters were fantasticthe only grumble is the amount of rubbish up here the mountain authorities try to employe a pack it out pack it in policy but it is not enforced they must try harder,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,actually been here in  i just thought that i have to write about this beautiful woman we hike through sembalun and went down to senaru the hike was really really exhausting and tired we took nd our expectation was nd one of our friend got cramp so we have to extend  night you have to exercise at least  month run  other exercise train your stamina because i got my back really hurt after the hike even we prepared for  month please prepare the physic i think that s the key for all logistic and etc normal prepare for how long you will hike keep in mind you wont regret this hike so prepare yourself give your best give your maximum power its true some people say this mountain is the most beautiful summit in indonesia ,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,such an incredible breathtaking experience to watch the sunset and sunrise in such a beautiful truly magical place we had amazing weather and the best tour guide ever it is very very challenging up and down it is a loooong and steep hike but absolutely worth it if youre in decent shape definitely top ten experiences of my lifedont forget to tip your guide and especially the porters what theyre doing is beyond anything most of us travelers ever could,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
1.0,avoid at all costs unless you want to camp on a rubbish tip  any ambience destroyed  beware shoddy companies to inedible food and substandard camping gear ,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
2.0,the trekking its really good however the mountain its full of dirt and rubbish despite the  euros you pay for it the dont care about it and they dont clean it either very sadyou should know that you can do the trekking by your own besides the mafia agency tries to convince you otherwise,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,exploring gunung rinjani national park is amazing  i would highly recommend it for any lover of the outdoorsi went on a senaru crater rim trek with rinjani dawn adventures and was very impressed with their professionalism and customer service the company is owned by a scottish guy angus and a local partner aef compared to other companies i spoke to they were easily the most professional  angus has many years experience in rescue and clearly cares about the environment and community this year rinjani dawn adventures has been using profit to fund their sasak warriors initiative which has been building houses and doing other earthquake relief projects since last year all of the profit from my trip went towards building a house for a poor person in senaru which i saw with my own eyes after the trek many companies say they care about the community and environment but you can tell these guys are genuinethe trek itself was amazing  its not as easy as it sounds rinjani summit has been closed since  earthquakes but will open again next year i for one will be travelling back to climb it when it reopens in aprili wouldnt hesitate in recommending rinjani dawn  great company and ethos and based in lombok unlike some of the foreign companies offering rinjani treks,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,we did the nd trek to the summit of mount rinjani firstly this is a very challenging trek and only advised for those with some mountain experience  anyone trying to sell it as anything else is lying for your custom and moneywe trekked from sembalun with bas rinjani trekking  one guide and two porters for two persons the first day is approximately km through very exposed terrain so in the height of summer this would make it even moreof a challenge as it was in winter  we still found the sun very hard to deal with for the first few hours especially in an already extreme environment where all your strength needs to be conserved the food provided was excellent and youll need it as we consider ourselves fairly strong walkers but the first day took eight hours of trekking the second day is the beast  you set off at am and it took us four hours of heavy slog in a sandy rocky surface where every move takes the effort of three steps to reach the summit there is no denying that the view is wonderful and makes up for the toil however the down climb is precarious with obvious landslides all over the mountain  our experience was one where we did question whether it had been a safe decision strong walking boots and poles are essential for this climb along with warm clothing for the summit it took us   hours back to the crater and then another five hours down km total for both daysthe landscape of the mountain is eerie as much of the hillside has been destroyed by fire and some trees were still openly smoking  the guide did not really explain what had caused this and we felt that much had been hidden prior to our trek including the obvious damage caused by the earthquake we felt this was in part due to the earthquake last year that has obviously devastated tourism to the mountain as the summit route had only been open a week or so before our attempt it was hard to see that this had been such a flourishing business now pulled back to a few groups on the mountainat one point you walk under a section of rockfall that feels very precarious and not much would take more rock to dislodge and fall across the route it seemed that the government were no longer interested in investing in the mountain and much could be improved with solid financial support for the trails and removal of huge amounts of rubbish that littered everywhere many of the porters wore flip flops which was incredibly sad to see and more should be done to get tourists to support companies that pay their porters appropriately to ensure they are treated fairlyour review of bas rinjani trekking  we paid  per person excluding tips for our experience which included transfers to our hotels and the home stay the night before the trek we felt this price was fair but unfortunately had some bad points as regards our experience we found communication with bas prior to the trek excellent but he seemed non existent on our arrival in senaru and we had to search him out for an explanation of the trek what to expect etc and when our breakfast was late the day of the trek it did not fill us with confidenceour guide was friendly enough on the first day but his english wasnt brilliant and he did not appear to have had any mountain training the second day he walked much of the route very far in front  it was like we did not have a guide much of the time and it appeared he didnt really want to be there maybe not after a  times this was a shame and made us concerned that if something had gone wrong he would not have been able to have helped usthe porters however were fantastic  incredible human beings who carried our food and lodging for the two days up to the crater rim the fried banana we had after the first day was incredible we had nothing but admiration for their perseverance and sheer strength and endurance also the driver who took us from senaru to the summit start and finish was safe kind and friendly,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,very challenging but i made it beautiful mountain and good company and guidei went up the mountain solo with my guide gde and two porters as my friend who was supposed to go broke his foot i am in average shape for an american from the south and i barely made it up it was incredibly challenging for me but gde was very supportive the two porters were very helpful and friendly as welli wrote a blog about it that i make no money from and no promotional value but i cant post that here as it breaks guidelines so if you want a detailed walkthrough of the hike message me or try looking up my name on medium and i will share the details that i again dont profit from,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,it is a long walk to reach the crater rim but the view is worthwhiledue to earthquake during summer  it is not possible to go to the top,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,this was by far one of the toughest hike ive ever done it was worth it to me upon reaching the peak it was beautiful and the visible stars in the sky even better sunrise and sunset was nice toothe only animals ive seen sadly is dogs and monkeys they told us there are pigs and deers but didnt encounter anythe tour guide and people carrying our food are extraordinary to be able to carry lbs up the mountain is beyond my understanding since i struggled to carry my own weighti do recommend the hike but be prepared for a challenge its very steep and requires extra caution take your time but not too much since its about  hours hike and thats at a decent pace,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam

5.0,unforgettable hiking mount rinjani in  days  night senaru crater rim hike leaving at  am arriving at the camp site around  pm waiting for sunset while enjoy some biscuit gived by our guide hiking senaru rim wasnt as difficult as going up to the top of rinjani its a great hike under the green forest until pos  and then for the final climb you emerge in the bush and make the final climb with stunning views across to gili islandagung and javawe were delighted with the quality of food especially as we were up in the mountains  totally did not expect a varied selection of rice noodles spaghetti for our meals the meals always came with a variety of fruits which included apples oranges pineapples watermelon,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,this is a long hot climb like many volcanoes i think of it as relentless a lot of the lower climb is in the shade of the jungle where you can see monkeys and the occasional butterfly unfortunately also plenty of toilet paper and plastic litter this is the draw back with huge groups of tourists and porters carrying many kilos of stuffalong the way there are a number of well spaced resting areas the lower sand becomes fine volcanic dust near the crater rim which gets everywhere and is super abrasive so i recommend bringing older hiking gear and not your new favourite jacketit is hot during the day and relatively cold at night i appreciated two layers of merino and a primaloft at the topthe view is absolutely stunning and worth all the effort the star gazing also amazing if you have a buff or similar you might lift to bring it as a face mask for the way down when  people kick up a lot of dusti hike regularly with my friends but the steep consistent relentless descent took its toll and  hours after the descent the doms kicked in and we were all walking like marathon runners,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,it is incredibly challenging super scary and probably unsafe but im so happy to have done it now that its over ,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,we went on a  day hike and we enjoyed every moment the landscape and views are superb and let you forget about the busy life good to have a guide as he can show you all the best spots around,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam

5.0,the trek was a fantastic experience we did the d n trek with jou trekking as the actual summit is still closed at the moment we where blown away by the service provided by our guide ronnie and our two porters every meal we got surprised in a really good way ive been to many mountains on my own but never had the luxury of freshly cooked and different mealsfrom start to finish jou the guide rinnie and porters were friendly and very helpful they provided great food and drink throughout the trip and ensured we had a great experiencei highly recommend using jou trekking although it is slightly more expensive than other companys they protect the mountain by picking up litter they are so accommodating by providing everything necessary and more for the climb,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam

4.0,my friend and i hiked mt rinjani in late july of  leaving at am to climb up once we got to the gate we where hassled to hire a guide and or porters but we are experienced climbers and came prepared with our packs fully packed including food water tent etc we were physically forced to buy a train entrance fee where it was rp for locals but then rp for foreigners per day when we asked for documentation or identification one of the porters threw on a shirt with an ironed on badge and said he was the government after yelling and screaming at us we had to pay the fee but when we asked where the money was going and they said to the government to stop corruption which is telling of the operation being run out of the tent as the situation escalated a kind guide approached us and helped us get on the mountain so if you are ones looking to book a porterguide book through aman trekker rinjanisummitcomonce that was sorted out we had our tickets paying rp for the both of us for two days on the mountain and we made sure we were not getting a guide we hiked up the trail which was easy to follow because there was just one continuous trail up to the crater rim the trail itself however was very steep and once we were above the tree line the trail became very dry dirt which made it difficult at times our legs were on fire my the time we reached the last rest stop but at the same time we were moving at a fast pace arriving to pos cemara  at amwe rested for a little less than an hour where another group with a guide arrived as well and that guide august informed us that we needed to get up before the porter groups claimed the campsites on the summit our final push was even steeper but once we arrived to the top wind was howling out of the crater and up the side of the mountain which made our tent set up a little challenging but not impossible the tent we rented was a low quality tent that had broken zippers on the rain fly as well as door which was our mistake for not properly checking before we began in the morningwe watched the sun set into the clouds which was incredible to see while all the other tour groups were also around us having their campsites and food prepared for them by the porters but thats the premium they pay for we were fine on our own eating dry food and camping ourselves but i would warn that the trail is fairly dirty and not well maintained by the park officials using the quotations quite literally here once on the mountain the porters and guides are very friendly but you just have to push through in the beginning at the gate aman told us about the app erinjanj where anyone can book tickets so that might save you from nearly fighting the staff thereall in all it is a steep and difficult climb but if you take your time going up and down anyone can accomplish it book tours for convenience but you can absolutely complete it yourself if you come prepared and have some outdoor experienceknowledge,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,this place is paradise i went here with my wife for honeymoon and this place is perfect for itit was an exhausting hike and i wouldnt think we can make it if it wasnt because of porters and the guide making our hike easierbecause there are many companies to choose from let me help you save your time and recommend hike with rinjani fudl from booking until we left the place the service was on point and amazing the other reason is they have charity project so i wanted to contribute a little bit by trekking with them you are welcome,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam

5.0,so mid june update the only open path is to senaru crater rim from the rim the path down to the lake is closed due to landslide of course is possible to go down but will be risky and one will need some rock climbing abilities obviously the path to the summit is also closed but with the same observation as above if you have hiking experince and you have camped before on a mountain you can go all by yourself no guide or porter is needed you can rent tent sleeping bag and matress from senaru for k idr there is no water source on the path to the rim take enough water and food for  days during the dry season on the volcano the weather is very cloudy between am to pm the night and early morning is cristal clear sunset and sunrise are amazing it is possible to be done during one day if you leave at  am from senaru to be at  am on top of course high fitness level is needed as you will gain and loose m altidute same day during long  hours hike the path is easy just normal hike yesterday there eas nobody at the ticket booth so the entrance was freeenjoy and take all trash back with you tell that to porters as well ,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam

5.0,last week me and my wife stacy went to mount rinjani for the first time we booked our dn trek from senaru with a local trekking organizer rinjani foundation the customer service is really friendly and great also reply pretty fastanyway when we first began the trek it was kinda hard and my body was giving up on me my wife has a weak physical so i had to take care of her along the trek it was really hard for both of us our guide safar was really helpful he kept encouraging us and giving many useful tips for the trek also i have to tell you about one of their cook nasir he is one of the best cook i have ever seen the meal he prepared was really great and i wish i could have it againso after the long trek we finally arrived at the crater rim and you wont believe what i saw you will have to see that kind of view once in your life i can guarantee you wont regretit was a really great experiences and i wished i could stay longer and went to the top of the mountain but i heard from the locals that the summit is still closed by the government i really hope that it can reopen soon so that i can plan to revisit one more time,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
2.0,i did the two day crater rim trip with a local tour company that were great but the mountain itself was disgustingso much garbage plastic toilet paper wet wipes human waste tampons etc this i coming from both porters and touristsit was sad and quite unbelievable that when i mentioned it to others a few didnt notice yet every place you stepped on to go to the bathroom you would step on human waste and toilet paper not an ounce of an attempt to bury it hiking in the mountains we must respect nature pack it in pack it out even your toilet paper it doesnt compost as quickly as you think and other people dont need to see your garbage as well bury your waste properly if you dont know what that means google it and you will be guidedthe locals are not as educated as the rest of us when it comes to garbage so if you plan to hike this trail please respect it garbage along the trails was numerousalso there was a woman with a drone at am when people came to watch the sunrise in a small spot the woman decided her work was more important than to respect the many others that had paid to hike up this steep ft trail to see a sunrise but she didnt care so her drone i am sure appeared in many photos not to mention the noise the drone createsi was disappointed in the trail and the disrespect to the mountain and to the other tourists to me its not worth it the view is great but there are better places to be where you can truly enjoy a mountain top,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,from dry grass land forest trekking to fantastic m summit view stunning sunset over the crater lake from plawangan sembalun tips trekking poles will be useful on summit day due to sandy terrain,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam

5.0,rinjani is an incredibly beutiful and unique volcano i was able to climb to the crater rim not to be summit because of the earthquake however the view down into the crater rim is breathtaking an image i will never forget ive climbed volcanoes all over the world and rinjani is the most impressive of allthere is also abundant wildlife such as monkeys birds and insects along the trail at the beginning you walk through some fascinating local villagesi was lucky and a dog from the street did the entire hike with meif taken at a slow pace anybody can do this hike you dont have to be in great physical shapei did do the hike as a day trip without a guide but i wouldnt recommend this for most people im vet experienced in this area plus since the earthquake the locals have lost a lot of business so it is great to support the locals hereeven if climbing rinjani doesnt interest you still visit the beutiful tranquil town of senaru where the trail starts the locals are very friendly and there are two easily accessible waterfalls that are amazing,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,we hiked as a group of four with the aim to reach the summit and we were glad to accomplish it it was tough cold windy and we didnt make the sunrise still the views from the summit and crater rim were stunning the guide adi and four porters one porter per person were helpful and concerned for our safetycon it gets crowded during the holiday peak period so its difficult to move about there are other alternative routes to consider,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,if you want to climbing the mountain when you take a vacation in indonesia especially lombokits the best choose to try,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,the summit of mt rinjani could reportedly be reached from aik berik central lombok it is  i was told no longer possible after the julyaugust earthquakehowever if you do manage to find someone to bring you up my guide ronnie says that at  m rangers stop any trekkers from going higher as the route remains broken and unstableaccess to the crater rim itself is possible only from senaru villagei went up with ronnie my guide and  porters as the aim of my trip was a ramble to see bird and animal life and this took  nights camping  spent on the crater rimfrom the crater rim we could see segara anak the crater lake and gunung bahrujari the post caldera coneon a clear day day  sunrise we saw the peak of rinjani opposite the crater rim base campaccess down to the lake has also been cut off though it was a lovely cliff face walk beforethe hot springs which are inside the crater itself can of course also not be reachedotherwise from sembalun village access has also been cut off and no one can access the path to the crater rim m above sea level one can only reach post iii or iv at m and the last  m of path to the crater rim can no longer be trekkedusually trips to the crater rim are dn with a guide and a portera guide is essential and unguided trips are not recommended as there are still unstable areas around the rimi was lucky to get a good careful and reliable guide ronnie paslah  whatsapp infowonderfullrinjanigmailcom he chose a campsite away from the rim for the  nights we camped thereit is critical to ensure one gets responsible guides as we felt mini tremors both nights on the crater rim and campsites need to be chosen with care not too close to the edge is the basic rule of thumbthe downside is while the view is spectacular there is rubbish  open toilets wet wipes and tissue paper all along the way and much trash which each group had not bothered to clear away accumulated at each of the posts and midposts sheer pity that no one feels responsible about keeping the national park pristine,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,i went to mount rinjni on th december via aik berik the only available route  in lombok to hike because of landslide that cut wellknown route sembalun and senaruvia aik berik route i was encountered with an awesome experience started with the waterfall unforgettable crater rim  and back to different waterfalli went there with a trekking organizer so called rinjani foundationbecause i searched so many sites and the others trekking organizers they dont seem to have this route availablei recommended this route if you really dont have any options available,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,full on blown away the best trekking company and scenery i dont even know what to say like just completely overwhelmed i was planning to go to bali and wanted to climb the mount rinjani when i suddenly heard that it was closed due to the earthquakes that hit lombok last augustive always wanted to hike mount rinjani since everyone i know was talking about it the beauty of the most beautiful mountain on south east asia so i kept on researching about mount rinjani and im glad i did the mountain is opened on th of november  days before my trip to lombok but the only opened route is from aik berik and its only  days night max its only a crater rim trip but its worth every second of it simply the best short hike ive ever been the scenery the sunset the waterfalls everything we got the cloud forest waterfalls and the track for ourselves because everyone still doesnt know about itand lastly this all can never be done without trekking with rinjani foundation theyre the only trekking company that i know provides the trip to aik berik i dont pick the company because of what they offer but what their mission is mr rifal our guide tell that this company is built to alleviate poverty around mt rinjani check them out note mt rinjani will be closed from january to march so make sure dont miss it out and the food is so good d,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,really enjoyed the scenery the surrounding climbed and summited twice in aug and maygreat place for camping nice people will plan to go there again once everything goes back as before,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,with  meters above sea level altitude this mountain is little bit hard to hike for the cone structural tropical location the trek so complete with savana soil rock sand even waterfall the mostly hard and dangerous is between peaklake and lakepeak we look like climb the high wall in the morning the majestic lake will say hello to you and also in the sunset time ive been there with some great people from samping rumah and we hike with use no plastic finally you need to stay longer at there,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
1.0,i just came home from the rinjani treck and i must say i am furious im sad and im mad and i wish id never put my money in a business that destroys our nature everywhere is plastic lying around not just small scraps here and there i am talking heaps and mountains and big areas where every square inch has a pieces of trash justbottles caps plastic bags gumwrappers noodle flavour packaging noodle cups toilet paper band aids fruit wrappings empty soap bottles  the mountain is drowningevery morning after sleeping and eating in a landfill i cleaned our camp completely but to clean the entire mountain is already impossible its been destroyed forever why because most tour companies dont care the local authorities dont care and the tourists dont care but if you care stay away and spend your money on something that dont ruin our nature,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
1.0,we were told that for people in their s the oneday hike to the rim of mt rinjani would be demanding but okay it was not we started at am running uphill with a guide who could barely speak english  just to descend after watching min of the truly fantastic sunrise at the rim of the volcano lake our guid has forgotten his jackets and it was freezing cold bring warm clothes we were basically hiking straight for  hours without any breaks the mountain itself is in poor condition and covered in trash the whole tourism organization is a pity and nature is not that special comparable to the unique beauty of the german odenwald or so only up the mountain the views are breathtakingif you happen to be around and should you really consider a hike there let it be  days but be prepared to sleep on cans and fishbones,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
1.0,the amount of rubbish and visible human waste is so heartbreaking it was difficult to admire the national park park entrance fee that money definitely isnt going into cleaning up all the rubbish left up there i would recommend looking into another trek,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,first hike its really toughminimum sleep and having to set off at am in pitch darkness and coldnesslast portion was the most challenging with each step up and half a step sliding down this would be the part mental power comes in to overcome physical fatigueits a great hike though i took way too long hours to reach the summit,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,mount rinjani is stunning we did the  day trek which allows you to sleep at the lake and enjoy relaxing in the hot springs day  is about  hours of hiking to reach camp at the crater rim day  takes about  hours to summit then make your way down to the lake to relax day  takes about  hours to reach the other crater rim and day  takes about  hours to hike out if you do the dn then you will hike for about  hours and day  bring good shoes and warm clothes it is very very cold not just the summit but the crater rim alsom it is quite windy and cold,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,it was a dnphysicallyexhausatedbutspirituallyacomplishedtrekking from sembalun to senaru no amount of words can describe upon the feeling you gained while you are standing at the summit of mt rijani the attack to the summit was more than challenging it seems impossible as the small rocks sand and pebbles along the way to summit forces you to keep sliding down for every step you made its tough but worth your efforts one would feel like standing on top of the world after reaching the summit views sights and sceneraies along the way are awesome  the weather is favourable to all the hikers though temperature do drop at night we walked at least  hours a day to move from one camp site to antoher we all felt accomplished after we reach the senaru villagewe went with ken climber team the support giving throughout the trip from the whole team including our porters and guides were really great without them for sure we wont be able to make our trip with a calm mind they do take care of us and make sure all of us return home in one piece lendry and sting they are our guides and they both eager to help you as they go extra miles for you we all appreciate their help care and kindness,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,my first trek experience and it was amazing trekked with six friends in one group i thought that i couldnt make it but finally i can make itstart this trip from bali and took morning flight to lombok i would like to advise you to book the trusted airlines i booked the budget airlines and it just ruined my trip my carrier strayed to jogjakarta insteadarrived at hrs at lombok and just left from the airport at noon extra two hours at the airport to claim my carrier and they said the carrier will arrive at the night and it was to late after discussed with the guide we decided to start trekking at hrs without my carrierwe start trekking from sembalun route on the first night we camp at pos ii sembalun and had dinner there next day we start trekking at hrs after breakfast the track was easy from pos ii to pos iii but after pos iii you will go bukit penyesalan which was the hardest track second night camp was at pelawangan sembalun i decided to not continue trek to the summit coz too tired and just rest at the camp until the next dayon the third day we continue trek to segara anak lake the best part of this trip the track was so difficult and dangerous you must be careful and pay attention with your step arrived at the noon you will see the amazing view of segara anak lake and enjoy one night camp over thereday fourth we start trekking to senaru afer we had breakfast after we reached pelawangan senaru you will facing the medium difficult track please use proper shoes coz the track someone time slippery we arrived at hrs at senaru village and thats the end of the trip so proud that i can make it,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,we did the dn trek from sembalun to senaru and it was an absolutely incredible experience the views from both sembalun and senaru crater rim were stunning as were the views from the summit of mount rinjani the climb to the summit is very very challenging especially the last hour or so where for every step you take you slip back at least one step but it is totally worth it when you get to the top for sunriseit does get cold at night so make sure you have the appropriate clothing guides and porters are amazing and do a fantastic job for youunfortunately there is a lot of rubbish all over this trekking route including human faeces and toilet paper right next to the path as it is a very busy and popular route you do pay a park entry fee and i am not really sure what this goes towards perhaps it could be going towards cleaning up the mountain there are some very easy solutions to get rid of this disgusting eyesore which could ruin some peoples experience drop toilets at the main campsites and pos they have these all over nz without any issues either every group that goes up has to collect a bag of rubbish or send a group up purely to collect bags of rubbish i am sure that any trekker would even be happy to pay an extra tax to fund this fine any company that leave their rubbish have designated areas for compostable food wastethis was a truly magical and incredible experience but the indonesian government need to do more to properly care for such an incredible natural beauty,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,if you are a true nature loverand dont want hike in dusty and crowded route like sembalun senaruthen this route is most suitabletetebatu village is on the southern part of rinjani mountainjust like any other mountain village in indonesiabeautiful landscape and loving peoplehiking from tetebatu to rinjani is just like you are doing a meditation tetebatu is not touristyyou cant find many people in this virgin mountain trail the small path leads to you through small streamsgrass landsand thick jungle covered in cloudsfrom tetebatu we can only access to the south peak of rinjani which stands about  mtrsyou will get an amazing view of the lakebaby volcano and of course  deg view from topgilli islandsmt agung baliand sumbawa islandsnot many people choose this traillet it be the same no garbage issues like other rinjani trails only two groups hiking that dayand next daywe didnt even seen a single hiker the trail is not as easy walk and it will take dn,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,we would like to undertake an excursion to the volcano crater would it be possible for two families age childrenall girls      en  to walkclimb one day up sleap on the crator and walk back the following day or is that too difficultthxkris,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
2.0,firstly i must say that mt rinjani is a truly spectacular place plus the guide and porters who took us up there were fantastic so why the poor rating simply because of the way in which the whole area is managed which consequently has led to the few paths and campsites being overrun with people completely covered in rubbish and even worse human waste ie shtwe booked a  day  night trip but told our guide that we couldnt actually think of anything worse than staying another night plus we bumped into other tourists who claimed that they saw human sht floating in the hot springs which was our next stop after the summitall trekkers are funnelled down one main path and only allowed to stay at one of the three campsites there are no bins and no toilet facilities resulting in everyone chucking their rubbish on the floor and crapping in the nearest bush as there are hundreds if not thousands of people trekking at any one time you can imagine what impact this must have on the surrounding environmentthese huge issues could so easily be resolved by the park authorities who after charging everyone to enter the park seem to pocket the cash and do nothingall they need to do is simply create more trekking routes and campsites to help disperse the huge crowds of people install basic long drop toilet facilities install various bintrash sites for people to dispose of their rubbish heavily fine those trekking companies guides and porters who chuck their rubbish or crap on the floor if there isnt the funding available which would amaze me if there isnt then charge more for the park entrywe did go during a busy time directly after ramadan when all the locals are on holiday but i really want people to put more pressure on the park authorities to stop this beautiful place being completely ruined i cant understand how others are leaving such positive and misleading reviewstrust me it is much worse than you think it will be especially during the busy seasonif you are reading this and wondering on what to do climb a different volcano there are loads in indonesia and with less touristsor even better find a guide who will take you off the horrifically beaten track away from the crowds and the rubbish you would have the most amazing timebut if you have no problem with rubbish and human waste everywhere then just trek with everyone else youll love it,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,first of all some recommendations to consider before starting the trek buffs its dusty more or less all the way and the sun might furthermore burn quite a bit extra snacks the tour guides do provide you with snacks but it is kept at a minimum compared to what most trekkers would consider appropriate warm clothes if you want to make it all the way to the summit of rinjani you need to bring warm clothes its cold up there and the wind is pretty nasty to be honest gloves are thus almost a necessitya bit about our tripwe were two danish guys who decided to trek rinjani in three days two nights with rinjanisanurutrekkingcom it was simply an amazing trip we had an awesome tour guide with lots of humor and great experience furthermore the porters that carried our food cooked delicious meals also vegetarian both for lunch and dinner there was plenty of water all the way and it is therefore unnecessary to bring water yourself as it can be seen on the attached pictures the view is breathtaking and among other things it feels special to see both a sunrise and a sunset in the same daywe could not have asked for more but we should have brought more clothes we wore long pants a sports tshirt and a windbreaker on our way to the top however it would have been nice to have an extra warm sweatshirt or some kind of skiing underwearin short the trek is totally worth the effort and we really recommend going if you want a true adventure we would do it again at any time enjoy,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,the view from this mountain is magnificent one must climb the mountain to view it personally the trekking would require min dn if you are with a guide eating dust is unavoidable here during the climb the entrance fee is not used by the local authorities to maintain the park though the fee is steep hopefully mt rinjani will have its majestic view for alot more years,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,i decided to tackle this mountain after seeing it online it was rather a lastminute decision and had no prior experience to hiking before but i would consider myself to be quite fit and my sister and i decided to go for the dn packagewe started from sembalun village which was an hour drive away from where we were staying in senaru and trekked up to the sembalun crater rim base camp on the first day we proceeded up to the summit the next morning at am and the h trek proved to be incredibly challengingthe views at the top as we witnessed the sun rise was well worth it though we then descended down rather steep descent the mountain and head towards senaru lake and the hot springs before we faced an equally challenging climb up to senaru crater rim for night be grateful for the porters and guides that come on the trek with you as the porters carry kg worth of food and shelter for you guys and carry it along the trek in just slippers its amazing what they can do all with smiles on their facesthe biggest problem that came with this experience was the excess amount of trash that can be seen along the trail its sad that people are not able to clean up after themselves and dispose of their trash properlysome tips its recommended to wear hiking shoes as they have a much better grip bring a walking stick i didnt have one but itll help a bunch and bring a mask or something to cover your face because all the dirt and dust will get on your face and in your bodysince its a natural setting its evident that it wont be the most hygienic of places but itll definitely help you appreciate the simple things that we have in our comfortable livesprobably the worst muscle soreness suffered from this trip but its definitely a once in a lifetime experience that i dont regret,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
2.0,the view is great once you make it to the summit especially at sunrise however the amount of trash piled along the track and the complete ignorance by the guides and porters that this impacts nature as well as the experience is just disturbing i would go up again but make sure to point out that they will get no tip if i see them leaving any trash on the mountain,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,it was really a special experience hiking mount rinjani i am not that kind of sporty person who exercise a lot i sometimes jog or do some cardio exercises before i went to this hike i went for a few hikes nearby the area but none are comparable with mount rinjani we took  days package which means that we need to hike for  days we were lucky we actually chose this package though it means that we were dragging the whole trekking activity to even longer and we got more tired due to longer treks we admit that we didnt exercise much before the hike but we totally didnt expect our speed to be this slow that we almost took double or almost double of time compare to others if we had taken the  days package we would definitely be rushing all the time and could not enjoy the view more the views are spectacular the mountain was magnificent you would forget all the difficulties you faced when you are at the top of the mountain overlooking the crater and when you are downhill again by the lake and in the hotspring you tend to forget your body pain and tiredness and i got one of the best sunset views of my life at our camping place for the rd night the food prepared by the tour guide and the team were simple yet fulfilling but the food might be a bit unhygienic one of us actually got something like diarrhea after our first lunch the camping areas were really disgusting its sad to see the condition of the area rubbish everywhere and people just poo everywhere ewww but other than cleanliness and hygiene everything else was good our tour guide even prepared some snacks for us during our hike and please remember to have proper hiking gear and clothings they are really important during hike and when its super cold at night,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam

4.0,we booked a one day trekking trip from senaru village to crater rim with my wife only one week before arriving to lombokour trekking started at am from our hotel trekking companys staff was very nice and in total we were very pleased with their servicebad news is that they didnt inform us well about the trip in first place they told us that one day trekking would be  hours of walking and approximately  km it doesnt sound that badbut at the end we bet it was much much more someone else wrote that they calculated the actual distance with their app and it was about km at the end i can agree on that our trekking day took about  hours with only  min short breakswe are in a good shape go to gym  times a week and run and cycle still it was most def the hardest physical experience weve ever had if you are not sporty type i wouldnt recommend this one day trekking trip at allalso when we got closer to the rim trekking was actually climbing without proper equipment the staff told us normal sneakers would be ok but it appeared that our sneakers were way too slippery we had to focus on every step so we wouldnt get hurtbe wiser that us book at least  or  days trip prepare well and get yourself a proper climbingtrekking equipment people have actually died during their trekking trips in mount rinjani so it is not a jokeanyway it was a fun experience and i can highly recommend it for those who love very challenging sports activities,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
3.0,epic hike   months of tramping in new zealand couldnt prepare us for this expect heavy incline through dusty soil  volcanic rock including a gruelling race to the summit before the sun rises am get up after hours rubbish sleep on a thin roll mat steep decline over very uneven terrain some borderline rock climbing lots and lots sweat and maybe some tears or at least harsh words to your other half bring earphones for the afternoon of the second day  trust me you will need your favourite tunes to push you also bring sunblock saw people doing this walk in converse and vans  my feet were ruined in walking boots i cant imagine the pain in flat solesporters carry x what you carry in a nice comfy backpack on thick bamboo poles shifting between one tender area of the neck to the other in flip flops whinge all you want but take endurance inspiration from these guysaside from the beauty of the volcano and surrounding vistas  there is rubbish everywherelunch spots are akin to landfill sites  the porters do seem to collect rubbish in plastic bags then wander off to dispose of them just after they have packed up pretty devastating seeing the ruined landscapes covered in plastic food waste endless amounts toilet rollbaby wipes and human poo there are no bins along the way  well there appears to be at the camps but the campers leave the porters just burn piles of rubbish at the campsso shocking we heard from a number of guides  customers that there are clean ups weeklymonthlybi monthly or not at all i believe the guides tell you this so you have hope  you cannot walk past that much rubbish and not ask questionsim stoked we did the hike and proud to have completed it we were within the first  to reach the summit but utterly ashamed to have added to the mountain of trash quite literally although we picked up as much litter as we could along the way even the walk up to the summit there were empty water bottles everywhere  it seemed as though the hikers couldnt pack away their own garbage without the porters presenceif you do this hike  please enjoy it  we used bas rinjani and his guide assan was a pleasure but please pack out your trash  you are not children and you can carry your own empty water bottleswrappers etc baby wipes do not biodegrade either  i thought the world knew this,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,first time to climb this mountain is absolutely very hard and also very tired lol but it after you reach on top of the mountain summit you get that you want you will see a beautiful landscape like you can see danau segara anaklombok island and sunrise i just only reach in pelawangan  because already tired haha next time i must go to the summit  km to the summit you should bring jacketglovehatsunblock cream and others nice experience enjoy it,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,this is definitely a mountain that i dont mind visit again and again no matter how hard the trekking is i love segara anak lake and would usually spend more than one night camping near the lake bathe in natural hot spring nearby plawangan sembalun is a nice place to camp as well too bad theres too much trashes and a couple of vandals here and there,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,this is a tough hike with very steep elevation the hardest of all is the last  km stretch to the summit the loose gravel is almost impossible and it takes a fit person to make it up therenonetheless the view upthere is breathtaking and make sure to bring a jacket with you if you wanna stay up there it can be very cold,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,i was where while i ran the rinjani race hard to climb and run but it is worth it stunning view from the top you believe in god when you standing in front of this volcano and after on the top life experience,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,its all worth the trek what an astounding view on the summit took this picture near our stop loved every minute of itthe crater rim was excellent much better than expected theres a hot spring too which really allows you to relax amidst that tedious trek,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,overall a rewarding but tough trek st day about  hours walking the last part straight uphill nd day rising at  for summiting it really is  steps forward slide one step back great view of the whole island of lombok be careful about summiting too early  its cold at the top back down for breakfast then  hours to the crater lake definitely try the hot springs very difficult to leave then  hours to the other crater wall camp day  is  hours downhill hiking poles are invaluable if your hurting on summit morning so is everybody else,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,if you like nature  sunrise this trekking is in the top list to do when you come to lombok  baliyou have to be in good fitness conditionsportal  guides are there to support you to reach the summitportals are the best cooker ever ,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,mount rinjani is indonesias second largest volcano and access to it is easiest via a village called tetebatu on the edge of the national park to the souththe national park contains monkey forests with a grey coloured macaque being the most common type noticed i found exploring mount rinjani and lombok very satisfying and would suggest a stay of at ieast  days if you intend trekking to the peak of rinjani choose your guides carefully i have found it very useful to learn some basic bahasa indonesian it is much cooler in the mountains so research before you visit will be helpful,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
3.0,you can receive very good impressions but dont be too picky and dont let the downsides ruin your experience it is true that there is some trash around which is a bit depressing there are many other groups there in the same time and some tourist simply cannot respect nature enough and can be noisy sometimes also make sure that you go with a trekking company that has good references please be extra careful uphills i have twisted my ankle and it was quite hard to come back injured i had luck that i could make it with a little help but if you break or leg i dont know how can you make it,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
3.0,my son  and i  both fit and experienced hikers did a dn hike to the summit of rinjani on  april  this is a challenging trek firstly there is a lot of ascent and descent from the entrance at  m to the summit at  m or so the descent especially is hard on the knees also the terrain is poor much of the top  is soft ash  gravel so its like climbing a sand dune  two steps up one step down there are water channels running through the path quite deep in places and easy to slip into dont even think about doing it unless you are experienced and have excellent boots and walking polesit hardly rained on our hike in heavy rain it would be even more difficult the ground was quite wet luckily there was no dustit is cold at the summit predawn beanies windbreaker jackets and gloves are essentialthere is a lot of litter at the campsite on the ridge but to be honest i was expecting worse perhaps it deteriorates over the seasonhaving said all this it is an enjoyable hike particularly with the changing landscape as you ascend the views over the lake and from the summit were very prettyoverall though i have to say that mt kinabalu in malaysia and various hikes in nepal and bhutan were more enjoyable,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
1.0,very beautiful trekking but you will see plastics toilet paper everywhere especially at each stop and campsi hope they will soon realise that if it continues like this the rinjani will not get as many tourists,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,i would advise to read reviews on the internettripadvisor so you know a little bit what to expect  dont underestimate the climb and be well prepared the weather can change in  minuts bring rainclothes warm clothes sunblock and energybars you walk in a line jammed after each other we were with a  person group only  made it to the top but when you make it it is beautiful ,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,hi i want to share the story  i climb mount rinjani at the end of december with team okyzrinjanitrekking and we made it to the top of rinjani mountain the height of  from sea level  and recently we feel happy and happy after we find the beauty of nature in lombok  and the okyz rinjani trekking team gave us the best with a professional guide and porter  we are so happy with this climb someday i will definitely be back for the second climb along with this team thank you okyz rinjani trekking i would recommend this,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,i was hiked this with a guide and a porter they were really nice although this was my first hike the guide was patiently waiting for me to catch up we hike from sembalun  plawangan sembalun  summit  segara anak lake  sembalun in  days because im still beginner but the experience and the scenery is breathtaking the best is sunset view from plawangan sembalun and sunrise view from the top while looking the crater lake and the whole lombok island from abovethis is definately a must do,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,to reach the peak of mount rinjani at m is the wish of every mountain climbers however to scale the peak is not easy and this climb is comparatively much more difficult than the m high mount kinabalu it is recommended to do the  days  nights hike porters will bring all essentials up and made shift toilet with small dug hole in dent will take care of our need the first day hike will bring us to the rim of the cradle and this hike is not too difficult we will dent there eat an early dinner and sleep early and wake up at around pm eat some food and get ready for the hike to the peak to view sun rise this climb is difficult because of the loose screeds it is very dusty and the constant sliding back makes the climb very tiring the last stretch to the peak is especially tiring and disheartening but seeing every one struggling to proceed does provide some encouragement for us to proceed the view at the peak is marvelous we descend back to the cradle rim took our breakfast and continue all the way down to the lake side the whole journey can be  hours and is rather tiring the view at lake side is equally nice we climb from lake side to the other side of cradle rim on the rd day looking back to the lake when climbing to cradle rim provides fantastic scenery at different heights the last day is very relaxing just walking back and to complete the hiking,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,the whole trekking processis very technical and challengingbut overall we were being taken careof by the guides and porters that we leastexpected kudos to them for the good job done appreciate it much thank u,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,i went there on august with small group this is my first hiking volcano mountain and i get good experience and picture also,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
3.0,we booked our hike through damai bungalows in gili air and they in fact sold us an illegal hike as the mountain was closed so when we got their locals informed us of this and this resulted in us losing our money as damai bungalows was quick to shift responsibility even though they booked it for us and we paid them we had to change our itinerary  so be care when you book,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,its cool and breezy throughout the climb although the summit bid can be scorching hot after sunrise the view is amazing and the only reason im not giving  stars is due to the litter everywhere and the lack of garbage management along the trek,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,never underestimate the mountainsthe finalhike up to the summit is the most interesting with one step up goes  steps down,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,i booked dn package tour in october  the climb from senaru to the base camp was tough uphill all the time however the climb from the base camp to the summit even more intense with strong winds slippery sands and pebblesdespite all of that the view from the top and the sunrise was absolutely amazing we also spend a night at the lake in stead of the sembalun rim and find it very relaxing and much less windysome tips trekking poles especially for the last bit of the climb before the summit warm and windwater proof clothes to stay a bit longer on the summit it is really cold and windy if you want to catch the sunrise which is awesome do leave early we left around am and just make it on time but you dont need to get there too early because of the cold try to watch sunrise sunset and the stars its amazing check my photos train yourself the climb was indeed intense be prepared for bad hygienesanitation condition along the way and at basecampshave fun climbing,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,we went to the summit with a pre booked tour  days  night the food and the guide was great and well organised the landscape is amazing the trek is hard especially the second day to the summit and all the way down so be prepare with good health and warm clothes the only bad thing is that its a lot of garbage all over the mountin,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,mt rinjanias a whole the volcano is amazing you rarely get a chance to climb an active volcano go inside a calderavolcanic hot springs and camp on a rim that said the trek is very very hard and not for the faint hearted you must be physically fit but most importantly mentally fit most treks are done over  days  nights with a guide and some porters these packages are around  and dont seem to differ even if you pay more you will do around  hours walking on the first day  on the second including the incredibly difficult summit ascent and descent and another m lake descent and ascent then  on the last everyone in my group managed it slowly but it is very tough and definitely book a couple of days to relax afterwards that said the views and sense of achievement you get at the top are worth it all all of the food you will get will be amazing as they want to keep you well fed for all the walking we had fried chicken nasi goreng noodle soup banana pancakes etc i really enjoyed the hot springs after the summit and would highly recommend it if you have the energytipsguides seem to vary greatly and might not fully prepare you for the trekbring warm trousers and a jumper as it gets cold at night also a tried and tested waterproof as you spend a lot of time in the cloud and when it rains it poursmake sure you are always hydrated as this helps the ams and also stamina on the h summit hike our guide gave us around  litres between the  of us and we were severely dehydrated for the whole trek almost not managing notbring snacks  you can buy oreos and beer at the first campsite up the mountain but bring lots of sweets and biscuits to keep youthe team going indonesians believe doing hard hikes on an empty stomach and so we were only fed a few crackers for the  hour walk to the top would also recommend tiger balmmuscle rub antiinflammatory and tissuesbut most importanlty tip and thank your porters lots  your porters do the same hike as you apart from the summit but they are carrying kg on their backs when you arrive at camp at lie down and complain youre tired they are exhausted but they will still run around and pitch the tents roll out the sleeping bags light a camp fire offer you teacoffee and cook you a fresh delicious meal never complaining and all with a smile on their face they sleep without mattressesbags because they give them to the customers and sometimes dont eat the premium foods they do a huge amount behind the scenes  from getting up at am to walk in the pouring rain to refill your bottles with spring water or washing up when it is freezing outside they do all this for under day i would recommend k tip per person per porter and more for the cookanyone who is particularly great,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,one of the most stunning experiences landscapes and journeys to take and look upon i cant take away form that but you must be aware that there is a lot of litter around  little is done about this if you can please take as little as possible and bring a bin bag so you do not contribute be aware that the final bit of the climb is particularly difficult it is sandy and rocky so can be fairly tough the top is exposed so take warm clothing for the final climb recommended to tip the porters who do an incredible job,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,mount rinjani is a breathtaking place we hiked from sembalun as part of a  day  night package the hike each day were challenging especially getting to the summit we did around  hours of hiking which gets tough as the days go on the experience is recommended if you like hiking volcanos and a physical challenge a good level of fitness is recommended as well as warm clothes and good hiking shoes the view from top is the most awesome thing i have ever seen with my own eyes please visit lombok and see it for yourself you will be disappointed by the litter and plastic along the route but dont let this put you off just be mindful not to be part of the problem you will be blown away by how hard the porters work facilitating the tourists up and down the mountain so do give them a tip and eat all the food the carry for you,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,if you fo to lombok you might do it because you dont want to spend all time on bali or the gilis lombok is more real nature rough and it offers the rinjani the rinjani is a volcano that is worth hiking but think about it for a moment this takes at least one night and two days the climb up takes roughly  hours and while others carry your bag and its still very heavy than you reach the base camp youll meet others eat drink laugh and go to sleep in a tent around  a clock in the evening sleeping wont go well and they wake you up at  at night for the climb to the top this is in total darkness and in the cold please prepare yourself with lots of water snacks warm clothing dry clothing and a headlight after the first few  meters itll be loose sand  steps up and  step down a lot of people give up with bleeding feet hurting knees and exhaustion is it doable yes but only if you are prepared and have a decent physical condition if you reach the top youll be at a magical setting shared with other survivors while watching one of the most beautiful sunrises ever i watched it with tears in my eyes ill never do it again i was so exhausted and had so much pain in my feet and knees but i am so happy that i did it and shared the experience,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0, days  nights for the whole route we trained for the hike by climbing stairs the few months before i think this together with sheer willpower enabled us to complete the hike i loved and miss the challenge as much as i was complaining during the hike the abovecloud layer  sunrise view and satisfaction at the top is awesomely rewarding,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,the hike to the summit of rinjani is mystic intense mysterious and at the end beautiful i am so happy we did it but at the same time happy its over i have a tremendous fear of heights so i have been worrying for weeks and preparing by reading all reviews some even scarier than others but rest assured its not that badthe walk up starts at am from base camp and during the  hrs up there is a tense atmosphere people are nervous and the hike is just super heavy especially the end but the moment the sun comes up and you see the summit reaching for you so closeby it gives you tons of energy the view is amazing and climbing rinjani feels like a victorythe walk down is also intense because then you realize what you actually climbed in the middle of the nightreaching base camp at around am you will have breakfast and you can decide to continue the walk or like us decide to cancel your second night because you are already satisfied with what you did and basically every bone in your body hurtsgo for it but try to be fit before you go,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,this was definitely a difficult trek which i realised only how hard it was while i was on it although saying that the toughest part of it was the summit day while the rest of it was very manageable i was disappointed to see a fair amount of garbage along the entire trail i wish that the guides and porters would take more responsibility in ensuring that nobody leaves garbage behind i would recommend making the time to go on this trek if you can club it with doing other things on lombok island but to go here just for the trek might not make too much sense in my opinionmake sure to have the right gear especially the right shoes as well as the warm clothes it gets very cold at night,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
2.0,the incredible beauty of this mountain destroyed by humans with tons of rubbish and faecesi would recommend people to stop visiting this mountain until governmentdepartment in charge take a good care of this issuesi think somebody in charge should give punishment for every hikers who doesnt bring the rubbish back down or they can try to reduce the amount of rubbish by giving bonusmoney for the porters if they bring a packor more packs of garbage when they are going downnote  local tourist are the more careless about this rubbish stop donating more rubbish to this mountain this is your country guys,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,you can definitely do this but the key thing is you need to go from senaru not sembalun as of november  the guys at the entrance will let you up without a guide at senaru and will turn you away at sembalun it takes around  hours to get up but be aware that it is steep and a solo hike should only be done by strong and confident hikers the view from the crater rim is exceptional an youll have some great conversations along the way with impresses guides and especially porters with it seeming to be pot luck if you get a decent guide or not i recommend going solo if you can manage it a tent sleeping bag mat etc can be rented very cheaply idr for the lot in senaru make sure you take plenty of water,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
1.0,we did the three day two night hike at mount rinjani sembalun  crater rim  summit  lake  crater rim  senaru we were very excited and really wanted to enjoy the hike and there were some good bits there are some lovely panoramas we got great views of ebony leaf monkeys and our guide and porters were caring and friendlyhowever overall the experience was downright depressingas we started towards the crater rim from sembalun descending hikers warned us it was dusty but it wasnt dust we were walking through it was the natural byproduct of major erosion the trails are a disgrace we lost count of the number of trees having the soil scrapped out from under their roots these trees will die and all the creatures that depend on them will be in serious troublewhen we got to the crater rim it became so much worse i cannot describe the amount of rubbish  food wrapping bits of plastic eggshells lots of toilet paper the trails just outside the huge main camp area were strewn with human faeces it was simply disgusting and an insult to such a beautiful areathe next morning we summited the mountain and probably should have descended back to camp with a sense of achievement however again we were appalled by the erosion of the trail we walked through gullies so severe you could take photos and put it in a text book as a quintessential example of gully erosion or how not to manage a trailby this point we were really depressed and feeling bad about contributing to the destruction of a beautiful and important landmark but i said im sure it will get better when we get down to the lake i figured less people go there and its a sacred site so it will be fine i couldnt have been more wrong no matter how bad the crater rim was the lake was so much worse there were piles and piles of rubbish some half burnt some fresh dumped everywhere while on the crater rim there were some attempts are creating toilet areas at the lake there were no facilities and no rules meaning there was human excrement everywhere the lake is stunning from a distance but up close it was one of the most disgusting places i have ever been it make me completely depressed about humanity and our interaction with the earththen it was up to a different part of the crater rim where there was rubbish everywhere and a descent down to senaru through more severe gully erosionoverall the experience was incredibly depressing clearly not enough resources are being expended protecting the mountain and its flora and fauna even if i tell myself well i didnt leave rubbish and our porters were good the lack of a proper strategy around sanitation and the fact i walked on already terribly eroded paths means i made a huge contribution to the problem which i deeply regretto be honest id recommend not climbing rinjini if you want to climb a mountain have a look at mount kinabalu in sabah malaysian borneo the authorities governing mount kinabalu are really uptight its expensive and you have to book ahead because they limit numbers but at least they are making some effort to protect their spectacular resourceim sorry to be writing such a scathing review as i said the local people we met were all lovely but mount rinjani requires a higher authority to clean the place up develop some strategies based on conservation best practice and the ensure these are adhered to until this happens id recommend against climbing mount rinjani,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,program trekking  dn dn dn top rinjani high level  first day a night restsleep in sehari you can enjoy panorama walk waterfull monyet forest good view rice field about the waterfull let see sendang gile n tiu kelep in senaru village m high level,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,if you visit the island lombok and you are in to hiking do it it is a great experience especially as it is a volcano however it will be a very strenuous hike because of the volcano sand from the altitude of the base camp,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
1.0,it could be impressive and breathtaking place but unfortunately it is full of rubbish and human waste whats more it is extremely crowded and there is no chance to admire beauty and tranquility of nature places where we put up our tent smelled urine monkeys which should be wild ate rubish left by tourists i thought that negative reviews are exaggerated they are not if i had known the truth i would have never go there,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
1.0,i booked the d n package travelling from gili awaited at a bar for my car to senate for  hours and was taken to a homestay where we were told to wait for the guide to come and brief us after  hours waiting he called us instead and briefed us over the phone this was annoying as it was late and we all wanted to rest and sleep considering the wake up time was ammy room had cockroaches and an ants nest under the front doorbreakfast on the day of the hike was one crepepancake  not enough to fuel you for  hours climbingthe hike itself was good and the lunch meal was very tasty and a good size portionunfortunately due to the mixed ability of the group i was in i arrived at the crater rim camp  hours before anyone else so had to wait in the cold temperatureswhen the porters did arrive they put up the tents which were all broken  of our group couldnt zip up their tent so we slept cold that nightwake up for the summit trek was at am and again we just received a plate of crackers to eat this last part is extremely difficult and crackers plus a cup of tea just isnt enougharrival back in camp after the  hour climb and  hour decent we were greeted with breakfast a pancake and some pineapple jam on toast see a theme heremy descent took  hours back to ground level and again due to mixed abilities i waited  hours for everyone to get down as the driver wouldnt take me he wanted to wait for all the guests the drive to the office was mins so he could have easily taken me backfinally the driver back to my hotel in senggigi was the craziest driver ever seen im ok with bad driving it comes to be expected in this part of the world but this was something else we twice asked him to slow downmy advice would be to definitely do the hike but try go in a group of people that you know are of a similar ability and take lots of snacks to keep you going,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,wow what an amazing experience after reading some horror stories on here about tropis touring company and weather conditions i cant actually tell you which company we used as it wasnt printed on my receipts but i think it was rinjani trekking centre in sengiggi anyway if you are prepared for pain you will experience much gain dont be stupid and rent gear bring your own water proof lightweight jacket flexible hiking pants and spare change of socks and t shirt because you will sweat a lot on the first day and you will want to change your shirt at sunset you hike for  hours with an hour lunch break on the first day its a very hard day i managed the whole trek without poles but i would recommend them for most people we had rain at our lunch break it wasnt great but after some hot food the weather clears and we continued dont forget its now the wet season in indonesia so expect some bad weather we got very lucky and had great weather on the morning to the summit we did the dnight it is an excruciating hike to the summit and only half our group made it but its absolutely worth it incredible views and it was not windy on this day an awesome experience but dont bother if you are not fit and think your just going up there for a nice photo opportunity  its a true test of will the bottom line is whoever you book with dont rely on them for anything except some food and a tent prepare yourself with appropriate clothing and take some extra snacks in your backpack most of all prepare yourself mentally and train for at least  weeks before you go and you will thank yourself,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,as you might have seen on photos already the climb to mt rinjani is stuffed with beautiful views and vulcanic landscape a friend and i travelled especially for mt rinjani to lombok and it was worth it we did a day hike on the vulcano including the summitwalk at midnightin a nutshell the hike consists of day uphalf a day summit day downbasically if you are relatively fit used to walking  hours upwards  with breaks of course  you will be fine for the  day up and down parts the challenge however lies with the summit trek it is not mandatory but most definitely part of the experience train beforehand so you can make it trust me itll be worth ittips n tricksbe sure to bring a lot of snacks such as energy barswarm clothing is a must especially when trying to reach the top including glovesbooking can be done everywhere around the island my friend and i travelled to the mountain and booked something there on arrival  expecting itll be cheaper than booking at an agency dont do this  we had to pay quite a lot negotiate a good deal at an agency and youll be fine,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,most amazing trip i have ever done in my life three days hiking in a lord of the rings scenery unfortunately we could not go to the top due to the weather conditions  very very strong wind besides that fact that the trip and national park was amazing  make a good choice where you book your trip our organisation was really bad and on the second day we were already out of water we had only one guide for  people besides that was the food served not enough for the effort  around  calories a meal while you burn over good shape and condition is recommended,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,first the trekking to mnt rinjani is an amazing experience but never with the company bas rinjani summit again we didnt get what we were promissed at the day of pickup we ended in a group of  people what is to big  the porters and guide dont get more money even if there are more people in a group but from the money they get from the company just k they must buy the food and drinks for the  groupmembers that means the more people the more the porters have to buy  the more they have to carry  and theres even less money in the end for the porters to earn depending on how much money they spend for the food because the porters couldnt carry enough water we had to drink refilled springwater which didnt had fresh taste so we definitly drink to lesswe also overpayed the trekking  what we realised when we were talking to the other group members yesterday when we arrived at the base we started a hard discussion with the company the part of the money we became back we gave directly and personaly to the portersfor sure go to the  nights   day trekking to mnt rinjani  its amazing but do not go with this company in our oppinion and make sure you dont endup in group to big hope that comment helps you to have a great experience,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,lots of people have commented on this trip and i dont want to waste your time repeating many of the things youve probably already read sono matter how tough you find this trip the views and sense of accomplishment are totally worth it dont believe people thay say you need a certain level of fitness you just need a certain level of determination  anyone can keep walking caveat if you do the  day night this requires a very small amount of nontechnical climbing and is not just a hikegoing up to the summit is as hard as everyone says however my tip to help you is this kick your toe in to the stonesand so you have a solid platform to push off from this will stop your standing leg sliding back on the loose soil and thus the whole two steps forwards one step back thing progress will feel slow but i promise you is better than trying to slip slide and scramble all the way up obviously durable walking shoes or boots are more appropriate for this than say a running trainerthe rubbish sigh yes theres loads of it but what no one seems to have mentioned is what this does to the overall experience other than impact on your views campsites are surrounded by rubbish which you can imagine attracts flies so after a hard days slog you settle down to eat your evening meal only to find yourself in the middle of a rubbish tip swatting off flies and the crater lake has the rubbish floating around the shores it really is grossi would still recommend this trip though  you get to climb an active volcanoe nearly km high with views over a crater late the entire island and neighbouring bali it really is incredibleif i were to do it again i think i would incentive my guides to take their rubbish with them in the way of a pre agreed tip perhaps,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,rinjani is without question one of the most amazing places in the world without question but someone has to figure out how to improve trash and waste management here it was really a shame to see how such a spectacular site has become so despoiled certainly individuals and tour operators can do their share but having a proper trash and waste management system would make a big difference,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,this volcano is simply stunning with an amazing view at the crater rim and of course at the top as well the scenery is superb and youll meet monkeys the whole wayi highly recommend to bring with you the following equipment hiking pants prevent from scratching your legs against trees frontal lamp extra waterdrinks extra food jacket windshell hiking shoeswhy am i telling you this most of people are not well prepared and i had to share my fooddrinksequipment with members of my group but also others and even sharing my food with the porters  trekking tours are selling this experience to everyone but it seems that only  of people can make it to the top  for our group at the crater rim level youll see tons of garbage that people are throwing away the rinjani is amazing and the nature should be preserved i sincerely hope this will consequently change in the future,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,rinjani is very beautiful with a very amazing trip and difficult to forgeti love rinjani and i definitely go back,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,great mt rinjani lake solo experience bit of a background for a full picturei travel to lombok often and mt rinjani was on my list for a long timei am  years old runner not fit enough for my standards but probably fitter than many on the mountain also need to say i am a sea level creature so alps residents would have an immediate advantagei enjoy heights views and nature but priority is an exercise particularly with a challenge rather than just to make the photo on the topi was unable to get any suitable advice on mt rinjani even from my lombok friendsaud    was not acceptable to me therefore i went to investigate myself and this is the following observationarrived at senaru near the waterfalls and the entrance late afternoonnext morning at  oclock did not have any breakfast prior exercise as usual left for the waterfallsgoogle map was suggesting a secret track from the base of the waterfalls after  km and  hours of searching i found only obviously obstructed possible passages however even pass the obstruction it did not appear as a good choice due to extremely steep and slippery overgrown paths despite gps i ended up in  different places  x and decided its time to give up therefore i headed to the official gate which was the th km of my track that dayat  i paid aud the entrance fee finished  litres of water and took another  ltr with me as no more fitted into the pouchthe hill starts right at the entrance and it is surprisingly equally steep almost to the lake the faster you go the more challenging it gets as you would expect my average speed was kmh up to the  ft altitude around  kmsone needs to be careful not to slip or fall but exposed tree roots provides often the best supporti believe at this stage you need certain fitness however no climbing experience nor any climbing equipment is requiredsimply the less fit you are the slower you gothe first  kms up to  feet was hard enough to break sweat but no stops nor water were required by my bodypeace of piss i though at that stage despite the fact that i barely matched the speed of bare foot or thongs wearing sherpas with  kg on their shoulders km to go only  of what i already covered from base in  hours ill see the lakes at no timeat six thousand feet altitude i appreciated the water i brought and used it wisely i also noticed i had to stop few times to catch breath my speed slowed down below kmhour and i thoughthats fair considering the climb my age and  km behind me on that day including my not very successful short cut at the beginninghowever within the next  feet altitude i have noticed my stops became more frequent and i even sat down for couple of minutes here and there obviously i noted my average speed deteriorated furtherat  ft i and  km to the lake i have though for the first time i may not make it considering i have to go the whole way back to the hotel my water consumption dramatically increased but as there were friendly hikers with water supply i pushed forward i always kept what i needed for the descentas i have not previous experience with steep high altitude no stop climbing i believed my energy is deteriorating due to simple exhaustion and needed to save the remainder for slow and save descendat  feet  km to go i had to stop every  to  meters and decided its time to turn aroundit simply made no sense as my speed was below kmh and decreasing the last kilometre maybe km would take me  to  hours and i possibly would destroy the reserves i still had leaving no energy for safe descent on timeon the way back at  feet i had a pleasant drink stop and a chat with a friendly guide for about  minutessurprisingly that was all i needed for the rest of the descend to the entrance as i was descending my energy was returning very fast to the point that i no longer felt exhaustion and did not need to stop the whole way downi have returned  hours prior sunset at  o clock i did not feel i need rest  unlike i expected earlier and with no difficulties got on the scooter and drove  kilometres to another hoteli would lie thou if i said i did to have a very good sleep that night summarisingi believe now my exhaustion was caused by fast climb to low barometric pressure at maximum energy available all the time rather than simple lack of body daily energy supplygroups i have met at  oclock near the lakes started at   hours before my departure at i started  hours after sunrise and came back  hours prior sunset i would not make it back before sunset if i continued to the lakes therefore next time i will start just before sunrise with plenty of reserves to make it to the lake and backplease note there was no plan nor urgency to reach any particular destinationit was just another exercise day with investigation purposescomparingthe climb itself appeared harder for me than  km run on a warm day possibly hardest exercise i had recorded confirmed by few record flags by runkeeperthe descend was easy but required extra caution to prevent injury due to slipping and or fallingif future climbs should i run out of energy in such suspicious way on ascent i would push on knowing the energy will fast return on descent obviously still allowing reserves for sunseti will take  litres of water maybe few oranges and a block of chocolate for the extra performancethe temperature was never an issue as i was moving at all time knowing there is a reasonable and fast return to warmer temperatureslittle bit disappointed because it felt little bit as a highway with traffic going both directions stopping for the rest and or for the night on the other hand i have gained extra safety should anything go wrongnext trip will be to the lakes and as far further as the sunset allowsdepends on those findings the hike after next may be across the lakes and return via the other site of the mountain subject my theory that the lakes were only km  hours away and no more then  hours around the lakes to the other sitewell and then it is only one other thing which can be added however at this stage i believe it will require an overnight stopany way this is my experienceplease do not consider it in any way as suggestion that it is an easy hike for an untrained or even worse unfit personhowever i believe reasonable fit person should make it to the lakes with a guide with no extreme difficulties the less fit you are the longer it will take but i see no obstacles to achieve the lake for most healthy and many less healthy people in my opinion if time is no concern it is rather determination than the physical ability what gets you all the wayi believe i was the only hiker without a guide on the day and i understood the reasons for it the paid guides and sherpas are your comfort and safety while their aud a week is well deserved  forget where the rest of your  go  never the less your own and very personal  to  kg still have to be carried up by yourselfplease note i am active all my life served in the navy as a diver and run on average  km a month i do not mind to rough it up and have some survivals experience and skillshappy to reply to any questions or if you fit and fun even to join me on my next tripshope this provides some background on the hike to the lake of mt rinjani,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,before trekking i had never thought that reaching to the summit was such a difficult process local guide used  hours to reach the summit while i used more than  hours to do so even though the process was tiring and exhausting able to reach to the top means lots to me i wanted to give up for many times due to extreme cold winds but still i made to the summitwe also visited to other parts of the park including the lake and hot spring and crater,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,joined by  porters the hike took about seven hours along the way food and refreshments were served the food was excellent and had flexibility when we took breaks or kept on trekking a lot of wild life along the hike and once we broke through the trees the view of the landscape was great all of the logistics were handled by dhyns pick up from the dock registration and finally a return trip to the hotel would like to come back and summit rinjani or hike down to the lake,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,we did the hike up to the summit in days nightfirst day  we started at h first long break at h for lunch its unbelievable what the porters manage to cook in such conditions we had rice with chicken vegetables crackers and some tempeh together with some sodas teacoffee and a plate of fruit we got to the camp at h the end was really really tough and all that dustthe view from the camp on the lake  wow and the sunset and the stars and the milky way amazing pity its very cold outside so impossible to stay out for a long timesecond day  wake up at am we started hiking at h and arrived at the summit at h right on time for the sunset the hike up is as described by others utterly horrible and then somehow you are up and in  minutes you have forgotten all about it with the view you are giventhe way down from the summit took us h and then h to go all the way down to sembalun againdont forget  walking poles for the summit part i dont know how people manage without them they will really save you easy to rent some at the hiking agency wet wipes a lot of them you have never been so dusty as here a mask we didnt have one and when you see all the dust you breathe in youll regret not having one very warm clothes especially gloves,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0, the best time of year to visit mount prepare some nesserrinjani is during the dry season between june to october for the best clear sky local guide and porters very important exercise before trekking there are several routes on rinjani the two main routes are via sambalun and senaru id highly recommend you to start the hike via sembalun route as youll hike up to the summit on the second day prepare necessary trekking equipment to hike to the summit such asgrater head lamp personal medicine mask sun block long trek pants and wind proof sunrise at the summit of rinjani was so stunning so we can do it,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
3.0,i undertook the trek to the crater rim with my family staying for night and returning the next day i like to be honest with my tripadvisor reviews but find it impossible to decide between  or  stars if i score the viewthe magical experience of seeing the sunrise over a still active volcano or the sense of being somewhere few people will ever get to see then this is truly a star experience howeverif i consider the filthrubbish and human excrement that accompanies you as you tackle one of the most arduous dusty and difficult treks and combine it with the experience of camping amongst yet more filth i find it impossible to award more than star the indonesian government should be ashamed of allowing this fantastic natural gem to be in this conditionon a practical note take warm clothes for the eveningwetwipes to remove some of the dust and i found walking poles helped with the difficult terrain,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,a tough but very rewarding hike sleeping overnight on the crater rim is fun and then its a am start and a tough few hours to get to the summit for sunrisethere is bad rubbish at the rest areas but there arent any bins  so what do you expectthe sunrise is stunning the last hour up to the summit is particularly tough as the loose sand and rocks often make you slip down the mountain worth the effort,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,a natural treking you can reach from both side senaru and sembalun senaru are stip but the fastest trek ever start from senaru and back from senaru approximately take  hours to go to the top if you are fit enoughthis volcano offering you big natural trees on the way up hot spring lake little mountain in the middle of the lake sunrise the three gilis look pretty amazing from the top  days trip from beginner check with the weather prediction and bmg badan meteorology and geofisika,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,ohsem view dari bukit selongpenat hiking tapi berbaloimust repeated again next timevery love it,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,rinjani is as hard as they say you will hate yourself for signing up while youre climbing but once you reach the campsites and the summit all of your frustrations will fade away because of how gorgeous it isthe first day is very tough the nd day crater rim to the summit is even tougher but your willpower will carry you through and i promise itll be worth it it also really helps to have a lovely group of trekkers that you become quite intimate with very quickly i did the dn trek and after reaching the summit most of my group defected to dn and decided to go down that same day while its cool to continue down to see the lake hot spring and the other side of the crater its not necessary if your main goal is to climb rinjani i dont regret completing the dn but i wouldve been just as happy going right down after summiting in dn i would say its up to you and how you feel after coming down from the summit to decide whether you should go home that night or tough it out for one more dayit is an option to sleep in while other people summit but i found the view from the top to be well worth the hike up and i was so tired from the first day that i had the mentality of i didnt hike all this way to not summit it really is significantly harder and quite a frustrating slippery hike to the top but if you think you can physically do it i highly recommend you doi had a really great experience but i would be careful in choosing a trekking company as there are some nightmare stories going around and some campsites smelled like urine as we passed by i believe mine was rinjani eco trekking but i really have no idea as my airbnb host booked it for me the tents and sleeping bags were wonderful the food was delicious and i surprisingly appreciated the toilet tent much more than i thought i wouldveyes there is a lot of trash which is unfortunate but thats kind of the nature of sea hikes there was no visible human waste in my campsites  they do a really good job of covering up the toilet holes and my porters were really conscious of carrying down all of our trashjust do it you only probably rinjani once,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,such a heavy trek but it is all worth it cliche but true make sure you have enough warm clothes with you,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,had read some info about the climb before and usually when there is a description for something it is given for the most of the people but not this one this is as hard as people are sayingclimbing this mountain is hard but if you are in ok shape you will manage it mostly on will and because there is no other way to take i did it in running shoes was ok but in hindsight i thing the way down would have been nicer to my feet if i had a pair of proper hiking shoes because youll need to break the speed from going downhillalso pack some plaster for you feet if you havent done so already as you will most likely get some blistersit was though a nice trip the shifting environment is nice to watch the hot springs do good for your sore body and the views are something elsewould i do it again nope but im glad to have done it once,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,in this review ill try to cover what i would have wanted to know before climbing the summitpreparation do a good mix of stairs and local trails and at least be comfortable carrying a kg load for about  flights of stairs with breaks of course before attempting itmost useful equipment strong headlamp trekking pole shoes with good grip  version from decathlon probably the minimum needed and wind breakerpackage unless youre in great shape i would have preferred either the dn sembalun  sembalun which skips the lake entirely or the dn camp in the lakewhen i did dn i barely had time to enjoy the lake when i had to go up to the other crater rim again afternoons are cloudy so we didnt see a nice sunset on the nd evening and our camp site was so far down the rim we didnt see sunrise the rd day either all in all the extra  day climbing to senaru felt kind of pointless and very tiringhowever is the climb worth it very godspeed,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
1.0,i wish i could give it a  rinjani national park should be ashamed of themselves rinjani is disgusting with trash and human waste an it detracted from the beauty of what it has to offer i was prepared for a lot of trash on the mountain which is prevalent in huge quantities but i was not prepared for the amount of human body waste and toilet paper everywhere at each camp site trekking companies dig small temporary latrines which they hardly ever cover up after themselves so when the next company pulls in there are latrines everywhere you food gets prepped and served over them you sleep over them you sit and walk over them you cannot step of the main path without stepping into human poo i work is hospitals and deal with a lot of human waste i am no ninny but rinjani is disgusting the national park makes to effort to maintain existing long drops build new ones or clean the mountain despite the k rupiah entrance fee per tourist try receive rinjani national park is an embarrassment to indonesia,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,the hike up the mountain was wonderful and the sunsets and sunrise was breathtaking it was not an easy hike due the the volcanic terrain but the sunrise up on the mountain top was the reward my only complain was the litter at the various campsites it is sad to see such a beautiful mountain littered by inconsiderate climbers and local pottersguides the park should be stricter in their enforcement to ensure that cleanliness is maintained in the mountain,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,definitely worth visiting even if you arent doing the full trek we only went up to the crater rim but it was brillianta few tips and tricks for the trip dont take this trek lightly it is hard you need a good base level of fitness to do this and you dont want to get stuck half way up climbing mountains is difficult and you should not underestimate this make sure you have the right kit hiking boots or shoes with good grip are essential i would recommend walking poles as well as it can get super steep in parts take a decent jacket with you a hat and sunscreen be weary of the guides and what they tell you that you can do really make sure youre comfortable with what youre about to take on there are limited or in our case no safety briefings before the hike so you really need to do your researchoverall the guides and porters are fantastic and will help you get up and down the mountain as best you can but just dont think this will be a walk in the park the view at the top is senstational and if you can get there well worth the hike,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,the place is magical we did a dn hike with cakrawala they were great making the hikingcamping experience unforgettablehere is what i think we went up from sembalun and down to senaru anyone reasonable fit can do it expect big crowds during high season especially at sembalun camp site there were a few hundred tents when we were there if it is too taxing for your you dont need to hike the last part to summit to enjoy magnificent views crater view at sembalun camp site in my opinion is already breathtaking try reaching the sembalun camp site together with your team with sky getting dark and weather turning cold searching for your team in the dark can be quite challenging we saw many frustrating hikers doing that have a warm jacket and torch light with you in case you reach sembalun camp site late and separated from your team keeps you warm until you find them soaking at the hot spring near segara anak lake is a must in my opinion it is really refreshing if you are camping next to segara anak lake make sure you dont rush and leave too early the morning view of the lake is postcard perfect we saw a few teams left when it was still dark they dont know what they are missing if you are coming from sembalun camp site to spend a night next to segara anak lake ask your guide to move a little pass the main camp ground to the next bay to set up your tent it is much more quieter there with less rubbish floating on the lake views from senaru rim is breathtaking as well yes there is rubbish everywhere just have to overlook it and enjoy the journeyrinjani is definitely the gem of lombok anyone visiting lombok should seriously consider including the hike in their itinerary,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,amazing vews from crater rim very cold after sunset and night hard as hell to get there it is not an average walk in mountains base camp is a total garbage dump no toilets and showers happy i was here but no more climbing there,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,definitely worth visiting even if you arent doing the full trek to the summit there are plenty of great hikes and things to see even if you dont go the whole way as others have said getting to the summit is a challengeif you have never climbed a mountain before then you seriously need to reconsider your decision to go all the way to the summit if you think you can make it because a brochure or local guiding company tells you you can do itclimbing mountains is hardyou need mental stamina endurance and quality gear you can not expect to do this comfortably because you work out a the gym a few times a week and have a pair of sneakers and a waterproof jacket with youlocals have been climbing this mountain all their lives and most have never been outside lombok let alone indonesia so they really have no idea how unfit and unprepared most people are to tackle this challengehealth and safety is also not really considered that much anywhere in indonesia  every outdoor activity we did during our  week trip across the country with a guide inevitably involved a conversation about how some foreigner had recently killed themselves because they went far too far outside their comfort zonesthe rinjani story involved a foreigner who jumped off one of the wellknown waterfalls because a guide encouraged him to do so  he didnt know how to swim and drowned when he got trapped at the base of the fallshis guide also died trying to rescue himsobering stuffso  yeah the local guides are very kind and experienced but just keep in mind  they have no context for your ability or lack of it and they simply dont have any training or understanding of health and safety in the way westerners dodont take your decisions in the outdoors lightlyknow your limits and stick within themclimb a mountain like this only when you have the skills confidence and gear to do it safely and comfortably,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,this trek route dn is not for the fainthearted and you have to be extremely fit with ability to climb for  hours straight for  days that is the kind of endurance you will need to finish this trek at some part especially from the lake up to the senaru crater base camp you are expected to do rock climbing on vertical slopethe view from sembulan crater base camp was gorgeous and beautiful at night and sunrise however the senura crater base camp is not as beautiful the mountain is littered with trash mostly from local trekkers because they are not regulated like tourist where a guide is required by the local authority to bring down all the trash kind of double standarddn is too tough for one to enjoy the scenery of this mountain dn would be better pace to enjoy the trek and view too alternative is dn trek up from sembulan and stay base camp for  nights and come down the same route,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,great view all the way around very tired but worth itonly gave  starts because the garbage is everywhere hopefully the mountain will not be ruined,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,its not easy but with determination and not making it on time to see the sunrise you can make it to the top by hiking slowly a pace at a time with walking sticks and proper shoes keep warm and something to cover up if you are slow as the sun will burn youtie your shoes lace properly coming down as you yr toes will hit the front of the shoe by the constant lugging forward on the long step downward walkits worth to reach the top so dont give up good luck,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,mount rinjani was a good experience for trekking it took us a day to reach near the base camp where the porters have already arrived and set up the tent for us we proceeded to trek to the summit at am midnight it was a great experience but tiring as well,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,rinjani is so beautiful with great view from the sembalun or senaru it has a nice lake inside on the trekking road i saw many great view lake view savana view the road from sembalun to the summit is hard but it is my suggest place for every one visit to lombok,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,we climbed mt rinjani  days  night to experience sunrise at the summit on the edge of the volcanic rim for the most stunning views of lombok and beyond is still one of the most proudest achievements in my life as this is no walk in the park im pretty fit and do a lot of bushwalking but this is by far the steepest and most precarious climb ive done and i relied heavily on my fitness to get to the top coming down is possibly even more challenging and demanding on your body particularly your knees but this is all made so much less daunting by the amazing local guides and local porters was incredible oky was our insanely fit guide who not only climbs it as a guide many times a week but also runs up and down it for fun he was a lot of fun always helpful and was constantly filling us up with fruit snacks and even a cup of hot tea at the camp he spoke english fluently and also seemed to have no trouble joking around with usthe porters cooking very delicious and tasty foods for lunchdinnerbreakfastthank you so much dhyns for preparing everything we needed,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,want to know more about suicide do it it was one of the nicest experiences i had in indonesia it is verry hard for firstimers,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,i joined  days  nights hike i managed to reach summit scenery of volcanoes are awesome and astonishing lots of trekkers set tents on crater rim very congested no water electricity and toilet at camping site rubbish is everywhere human faeces are in the bushes,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,i started the hiking to rinjani via sembalun about  hours from lombok airport suggested to use local guide st day afternoon around pm from sembalun to post   hours nd day take  hours to plawangan last camp before summit to top of rinjani from plawangan you can see segara anak lake awasome viewrd day begin hiking to top at am about  hours after summit suggest to camp at segara anak lake and descend via senaruprepare all your gear at lombok,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,took dn package to rinjani st day we rested at the base camp on nd day we woke at am to push for the summit after coming down we proceeded to trek around the area for the remaining day and last day views along the trek are spectacular there were rubbish all around given the high number of trekkers would be best if you kept your rubbish all with you towards the top volcanic sand makes the climb difficult  step up and you will slide down slightly slowly but surely will make it up the top,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,we began the first day to camp one then the second day to the crater rim camp plawangan sembalun early morning the next day am hike the summit so basically you can summit it in two days one night if not counting the summit night walk but would be missing the crater lake camping waterfalls etc so thats what the  days  night is all about nice landscape provided its cloudless which was present half of the daylight mostly btw the hiking trail is fun enjoyable and not too tough  hour hiking per day mostlydont get me wrong but it would be unfair if id say everything is ok i like the scenery landscape and mountains the only thing i dont like is the waste organic and nonorganic totally littering the place when i mean organic i really mean human waste not just the kitchen waste etc it is kind of sad to see such a wonderful place spoilt,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,went to climb mt rinjani via sembalun and it was so awesome the view superb the weather extremely kind and sunny the porters were amazing what with their speed stamina and ability to carry heavy loads the mountain took my breath away so beautiful so humbling at nightfall just sipping a cup of hot tea and watch the stars by danau segara anak watching the sunrise at plawangan was amazing experience but watch the sunrise over the whole of lombok at the summit of mount rinjani now that is mindblowing the climb is tough but you know what they say difficult roads lead to beautiful destinations,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,strenuous trekthe trek is amazing and worth of every step but is really strenuous and more than average fitness level is required it is also mental matter as you need strength of will to reach the summit the trek is really steep and slipper from the summit or rims there are stunning views during the sunrise or sunseti did dn program it means first day trekkingclimbing for  hours with some breaks second day the most hardest one you wake up at  for  to  hours climb up to the summit and back in about  hours after the breakfast  hours trek down from the rim to the lake where you have lunch and bath in a small thermal stream and then a final climb to the rim for about  hours  day just trekking down for about  hours nevertheless still hard as your legs are already tiredto choose the trekking company depends on your budget the program is the same at all operators the difference is in luxury during your trek bigger tents thicker matrasses chairs and the qualityvariety of meals while on the trek i could notice that the companies usually serve different meals and are not monotonous as some people mention from my experience is more important the party you are with especially if there are people with quite considerable fitness level difference when you book the trek nobody ask you how fit you are or explain to you in more details how gruelling the climb is and especially how hard the second day of the trekking can be trekking from am to  pm for me this is really bigger concern then the service during the trek just give your example our group had to finely split the second day after pushing our porter not the guide who we did not see as accompanied the boy who was permanently far behind the first day when we got to the rim at pm he came at  pm very hard to climb at nightdark second day after the summit climb ha was  hours behind with still about    hours climb ahead for us this would mean that our group would have to stay at the lake not at the crater rimas far as the environment is concerned around the camp sites you will see some pollution but our company and also others as far as i could see cleaned after themselves porters or guides carry rubbish bagsimport stuff to take or infotake walking poles will be really handyheadlamptorchsunscreenwater proof jacket for rainy dayswarm jacket and gloves for the morning summit climbwater bottle  it can be refill from the streamsgood spiritps tip your porter they do a great job during the trek,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,after many years spent in indonesia and dozens of friends telling me about their dn ascension of the brutal mount rinjani i finally got to the summit though in a different waywent there in the framework of a race the rinjani and i can tell you how hard it is but so beautiful amazing rewarding flabbergasting it was a hard race and i bet it is a hard trek too but defo worth it one advice  be physically  mentally prepared in terms of equipment too gaiters poles and warm clothes are advised especially if you aim at the summit for sunrise its not the bromo the elevation gain is high and its a super vertical trek with difficult terrain at the top sandy rocks so one step forward two steps backwardsalso bring some energy bars or food with you cause theres no station at the summit youll find some items for sale on different posts from sembalun lawang to the sembalun rim for examplebut please respect the mountain and throw your garbage in the dedicated areas or bring them with you all the way down and dispose them properly in the village gunung rinjani is a holy magnificient volcano so dont treat it as an open air trash bin,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
3.0, not only visitor but porter throw rubbish such as stove gass eggs mineral water screw the root of the tress as the place to burn rubbish dirty fountain scenery  for individual who want to save transportation cost thats little bit difficult,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,the mountain is physically challenging to climb up and thrilling to go down but the view worths all your hardwork,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,we took the dn trip from sembalun booking through chicken feet travels agency singapore we later found out that these guys ms jin completely ripped us out on price  got charged at least  more than booking directly through andreas expedition which was the tour group we were eventually booked with first tip  stay away from these sub agents and book directly through the local tour groups  good ones we heard were andreas green rinjani and john adventuresi will directly go to the key points in this trek extremely challenging trek  you need to have good fitness and prior trekking experience is a must this trekl will be the most difficult physical thing you ill do in your life  steep incline tough terrain which you cover in very short span of time over  m in single day which is not normal at all dn trek offers very little time to pause and enjoy the stunning views you walk all day and reach the camp so late in the day completely exhausted that there is no time to savour anything day  will be the most unforgettable and torturous day  day starts  am to go to summit m to m then you come down by  am and post breakfast get downw to lake m to m finish lunch there and then trek back to other side of crater m to m basically trek from  am to  pm  hrs with break of maybe  hours it will drain you physically and mentally carry very light  not more than  kg  it gets cold at top  carry fleece jacket trekking poles and good trekking shoes are must your guide and the porters are your gods up there treat them nicelytip  do a dn trek instead which gives some respite or best  dont do it the end,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,we did the dn which was too long as we camped right near the gate at senaru on the last nightthe dn summit walk is probably a better option and starting at sembalum is recommendedbreak in some decent hiking boots first bring a headlamp rain jacket and some gaiterssome spectacular views but a lot of rubbish in the camp areas and along the trailsa guide and porters is handy but not a necessity as there are a lot of people on the trail,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,there isnt much to say but at the same time there is a lot to say we were  dudes in our thirties and all in good shape probably one of the hardest physical challenges we have all endured the other reviews highlight to bring warm clothes and proper gear and blah blah thats all true i wont discount that but the real attraction of doing this is to see the sunrise at the summit thats no easy task and of the  on the mountain that day i think  made it in timewe noticed on the way down some folks struggling already on their way up if you arent doing well after  hours on the first day its honestly going to be dangerous and i would just say dont do itif you can manage it it will be one of the most memorable experiences of your life,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,definitely one of my favourite experiences in indonesia we did the  day hike which is not to be considered easy but  worth it my only criticism is that considering rinjani is a national park there was a lot of litter and was not very looked after well due to many campers  bit of a shame to see such a beautiful area not truly appreciated would love to do it again one day but this time bring proper walking shoes we proved it was possible in trainers if you want to fall over loads,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,lucky enough to share with my son the trek up to the rim of mt rinjani a tough ask for me  years old but well worth the effort we started a  am and trekked for almost  hours but had breaks for snacks and lunch and the terrain at times was very challenging the view was just spectacular at  m and as the night closed inwe witnessed an amazing sunset over bali a chilly night ahead and little sleepneed warm clothes saw my son and i gaze at the sun rising over the neighboring island of sumbawaa visual feast the trek down was not so challenging and only took about  hours certainly well worth the effort and i will do it again soon,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
3.0,dominated by the majesty of mt rinjani and the surrounding mountain offers stunning landscapes parts,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,prepare yourself for a long winding drive motorcycles are not really up to the steep slope unless new and highly recommend renting a car the transition from coastal jungle to mountain rainforest is gradual yet total and at some point you become awed by the majestic trees dense overlapping layers of the canopy and the sheer steepness of the climb monkeys abound the lower levels and along the road and there are numerous photo opportunitird the air is pure and the temperature drops remarkably so bring layered clothing or at least a good rain jacket it was cloudy and raining at the summit so i missed the views yet the air the jungle and the experience is something i will remember forever,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,beauty place to go i love waterfall fantastic there is  waterfall at these mountain and also sister mountain good for mountain lover,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,i will never forgot with this experience because the volcano exploded while we were on top of the mountain the warm volcano ash just splashed to your face no place to run and hide just pray nothing worst would happen we only hiding at behind a big rock while cant see anything clearly this is surely one of the best experience,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,rinjani is the second highest mountain in indonesia  masl the trek was really hard windy cold and rainy when i was visiting in dec the view was amazing it has beautiful crater and new mountain in the centre surrounded by lake segara anak dont miss to visit the hot spring water it is a must visit place while you were in lombok the cost is quite expensive but the trekker partner already prepare all the things we need very proffesional and experienced guide and porters,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,there is no doubt the view from mt rinjani is a once in a lifetime experience  but there are a few things you should know before trekking the mountain is closed from jan  to end of march we found this out the hard way as many operators will still take your money the main reason to avoid the trek at this time is that it is the rainy season we trekked jan th this year and luckily it was still drybut on the last day the rainy season began and we only just made it out through a number of river crossings due to the rains and no government maintenance  the track is appalling and unsafe in areas as in railings are falling down everywhere and there are huge cutouts in the trail personally i wouldnt let this stop you but it means you need to know the risks and be extra safe on steep climbs unfortunately there is also a lot of rubbish along the track so please take a plastic bag and collect some  and encourage your guides to not leave anything behind you will need trekking boots and waterproof jacket and also warm jacket as it does get cold a walking stick would also be highly recommended as there are many slippery downhill areas this trek is hard i have done everest base camp and i still thought this trek was potentially more challenging in areas just due to the technical aspects  as in a lot of hazards and not a great trail it is one of the most amazing views  and totally worth it when you get to the rim due to the latest eruption of the active volcano in the middle of the lake our guide admitted in the end that they actually are not really supposed to take people down to the lake and hot springs the walk down is also very steep again as a personal opinion i would give the lake a miss it is lined with rubbish and you dont feel like swimming in it when you reach the bottom plus it means you then need to walk back up the next day which is a killer if i did it again i would just go to the rim and back for the awesome views the best views by far are from the senaru end you can hardly see the volcano from the sembalun end unless you summit not sure if you can walk up to the rim from senaru and then across without going down to the lakepossibly you can the quickest way to summit however is from the sembalun end the summit walk it very slippery due to sandy little rocksso you need really good grip and a walking stick if possible they also summit in the early hours of the morning when it is dark so you need a good head torch make sure you check out all of the gear provided the night before to ensure they give you decent tents matresses and jackets if provided accommodation is really basic and ours had dirty sheets  so maybe best to bring a sarong or towel to lay on pack as light as you can possibly packit is a tough walk pack sunscreen and a hat and long sleeve shirt extra socks and bandaids  bandages enjoy it really is an amazing trek its just that the government and park rangers do not maintain anything,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,rinjani is super pretty its got a long trek and challenging but worth it however its full of thrash to attract more people to come and enjoy this place rinjanis management should have a waste management system they could learn from the management of semeru and start by giving briefing to anyone wishing to hike the mountain,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,one of the best treks i ever did you need to be in good physical health because it gets tougher at the end and gear yourself up because it gets cold at night especially the night before reaching the summit it is worth every single moment highly rated,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,experience of a life time dreamlike literally every step is a different storymentally challanging phisically exhausting emotionally elevating bring everything what they suggest you to bring youll need them alloh dont forget to hop in the volcano hot spring bath jacuzzi with waterfalls while yourere there,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
3.0,if you like hiking pristine trails where there is a well managed code of conduct fire prevention is a focus and waste is disposed of properly do not bother with rinjani national parka rugged and awe inspiring landscape on a beautiful island with friendly people has been poorly managed with most infrastructure crumbling from  years of lack of investment rubbish is strew over the whole distance of the park with every rest stop or widening of the path or vista or camp covered in littergarbagethe park authorities ability to cope with poorly educated lazy and unhygienic visitors should be better than it is incentives for visitors and their porters to bring back rubbish penalties that are enforced for those who litter and more clean ups and education are easy ways of tackling this problem the problem is now so endemic it will take weeks to clean up the place my friend and i even posed the question to some of the locals that the government get  low risk prisoners and have them go do community service by helping to gather wasteporters smoke all the time despite many signs of heightened fire risk this should be enforced as wellnow i have climbed kinabalu and fuji they both receive large numbers but are able to manage some of these problems with innovative thinking empowerment and some funding i wrote to both the national park email for rinjani and the local government to express our concerns and distaste at the maintenance of their parks but are yet to receive and sort of responseputting your head in the sand is not the right way to go about things hundreds of people depend on the tourist industry that rinjani brings that could dry up if more people experience the same and tell otherswould i take my children to this park no my wife no would i go again no did i enjoy myself and was i challenged yes most certainly but there was a deep depression growing inside at every step the park is in a bad way action is needed now,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,really tough but so so beautiful and an incredible experience stay for at least  nights if you can it would be such a shame just to go to get to the summit and go back down without spending more time there it is beautiful there are a lot of tourists this is actually not a problem and nice as youll see a bunch of people throughout and everyones very encouraging and supportive however people complain a lot about the litter yes there can be a lot of rubbish left around however people dont realise that in indonesia people are not educated on conservation nor is it their first priority  if you dont like it pick up the litter yourself to show them,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,i did the dn summit trek starting at sembalun a couple of days ago and it was amazing its true that its a tough hike but anyone who is somewhat fit can make it it may take you  or  hours longer to get to the summit so you should leave earlier if you think its going to take you longer for reference my girlfriend is a couch potato and she never does any sports and she still made it without any preparations i had to motivate her a lot but she managed to do it if you have enough perseverance you will be fine the problem was that we were too late for sunrise so if youre still on the fence do it but if you want to get to the summit before sunrise then you may need to wake up earlier so you have a head start it is also true that there is a lot of rubbish but the rubbish is mostly at the campsites outside of the campsites it is not that bad my advice is to bring good hiking shoes i did it on sneakers which was great until you get closer to the summit when you really need more grip and i was really struggling with the lack of grip you also have to bring a torch or headlight and some warm clothes it can get really cold and windy at the summit around  degrees celcius you get enough food during the tours but its not a bad idea to bring some energy bars or snickers last advice is to take a tour that starts from sembalun the biggest difference is that descending towards senaru is much easier because it is more gradual when your knees are not so fresh anymore,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,did the dn and would recommend going up from sembalun and coming down via senaru proper training required summit is tough having to walk through volcanic ash  steps forward  step back,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,i trekked rinjani solo carrying all my own gear including tent sleeping bag food and water i started from sembalun walked into the park from the main public road and i did not pay park fees or register normally i would have but the park office is far off the trail they charge foreigners more than locals and the park is not maintained well and is in horrible conditiontrash and feces everwhere most companies charge between  usd for the summit trek and provide tents food guides and porters to carry your stuff guides are not necessary as theres only one trail and its easily discernable porters are generally loaded with  kilos of guest gear and supplies and make the  daytwo night trek for only   to   rupees  usd for the whole thing you can be the judge on whether to use a company and porters but they are treated horribly and i dont believe in human slavery i also dont think you should be on the mountain if you cant carry your own gear but enough of my soapbox theres water sources at base camp and the second nights camp and there is another natural spring by the hot springs down by the lake no need to carry more than  liters of water to start and you can refill your bottles along the way the climbing is difficult because of scree but not technical and just takes a positive attitude and perservereverance there are many spots to camp and no one messed with my tent noise at night is a problem so bring earplugs the time estimates going up were generally accurate but i made it down from pos  on the last day in  hours not  i guess my knees are better than most take panadol or ibuprofen it helps and please dont poop alongside the trail go some distance away and bury it and pack out your trash,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,challenging but so worth it and so beautiful and the volcano actually erupted only ash highly recommend,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,i double dare you show me a place as beautiful as rinjanii did it in  days of sweattears and blood with one of my mate but its all worth it,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,one of the best places ive ever been not easy but you can do it when you reach the top you will know it worth it apart the stunning views and sunrise you will be able to se wild life like monkeys an amazing lake and amazing people the are always there the rinjani its a very important place for the lombok people you can ask to local about history and how important it is for them if you go to lombok you need to go there just one bad thing its too dirty in some places they need to preserve better that jewel,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
2.0,very very rough and intense rainy disgusting amount of garbage and human feces bad food hygiene the view was not too bad,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,this was so worth the trek but should not be taken lightly my husband and i are fairly fit people our job scuba instructors requires us to be active all day and we had a few struggle moments especially the first day towards the end the climb is much steeper than we anticipated but was so worth the view when we woke up my advice keep your pack light once you add the weight of water to drink it gets heavy but bring enough layers and change of clothes we got poured on so we had to change as soon as we reached the top and our original clothes never really dried also bring chocolate and nuts there is plenty of food provided by the trekking company but your body needs those calories on between definitely recommend real hiking shoes the people we saw in trainers were having some real issues we also brought wet wipes which came in hand lastly bring and empty plastic bag to bring down any trash you create it was sad to see people get some complacent with natureit is worth the journey and just think when you only have to be able to walk to the nearest massage place once you get down ,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
2.0,this beautiful place is now a giant rubbish dump covered in plastic rubbish it is everywhere the people running the trips and the the people camping on their own have ruin whatvwas once an amazing place probably the most dissapointing wilderness experience i have had in indonesia,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,if you like to hike and want to be outside civilization for a while go thereits a huge active volcano with a lake and hot springsplenty of trekking agency around with different offer and priceworth it,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,my first ever hiking outside my comfort zone certainly not for a beginner but well i have a very supportive guide this mountain have all  lake hot spring and of course the magnificent mountain itself indeed mount rinjani is the beauty and most beautiful volcano mountains in indonesiaprepared yourself to trek for this mountain be fit and make sure you get a very supportive guide and porters they indeed the best mountain cook i think and please please bring back your rubbish and dont kill this mountain with the rubbish,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0, main points of advice lots of layers and warm jacket and et again more clothes than youll think you need because youll need it all waiting for the sunrise on top on rinjani drains the life out of you bring baby wipes the walk is very sandy and you will be covered in a layer of dust until everything you own and you yourself is just one shade of brown be mentally tough because the am trek up to the peak itself is one of the hardest things i have ever done in my life the terrain is super tough as its all sand and very steep being in good shape and having good stamina from doing crossfit everyday my partner and i were still struggling loads youll get there it will take time and lots of willpowerso other than that the park is beautiful but very dirty from lots of plastic and trash thrown every where which is such a shame could have been such a beautiful and serene place but the fact that is looks like a dump on the main camping sites and stops takes the feeling out of it,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
3.0,we did the  day summit from sembalun to senaru with lendri the walk itself is challenging but very beautiful however i would consider not recommending to friends due to the huge amount of rubbish and body waste at and surrounding camp sites and trails,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,i start from sembalun through plawangan and summit going to the lake and finish at senaru the landscape is beautiful everywhere but it is better to visit in the low season so you will not queue when summit attack and please to keep clean,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
1.0,this mountain is such a sad depressing place the incredible beauty of nature brutally destroyed by us humans rubbish wherever you go sleep or eat and most locals couldnt care less the path the lunch spots the spring the camps  one horrible collection of food waste litter toilet paper thrown away clothes and human wasteanother issue are the graffiti local tourists are smearing their names on everything rocks treesthe worst place of the whole trek is the lake from far away its stunning and you really wanna swim in it if you come closer you dont even wanna get near the water anymore everything is covered in flies rubbish fires rubbish piles swimming plastic bags dead fish and rats they came to check out our food only  centimetres away from my foot shockingand as soon as their tourist group has left the spot most porters are starting to burn the rubbish only very few companies are taking it down like rudy trekker so if you really really wanna go please choose a decent company for the mountains sake and for your own the good companies provide way better food english speaking guides better material mattress sleeping bag etc and they take their rubbishwe went with rudy trekker and our guide even picked up rubbish on the way down we helped him the porters not so much maybe because their colleagues who were at the resting spots with other companies laughed at them depressing,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,not all local people got chance to trek this mountain i reached sembalun rim at around  pm then set anything to face the night feel so curious to see the lake through the rim while it foggy day there is a myth in lombok says that if you see the lake with small size it means that your life will be not so long thanks god i saw that lake so wide as every trekker seeseven it just myth it makes me soooo,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,we booked dn track and honestly speking it was very dificult to make it although for trained peoplethe tack is very dusty and slippery so in many cases you do  step ahead and  steps backduring the track there is many steap places to manage all you need to be in good condition and have a strong will to make it,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,greath experience hard but wortiednever try never knowso please prepare everithink like mental and pysicologiand do more sport before you come here we must walking  hour every days bring inap warm clothes alsothen somethink warm like jaketsweather and inap water and snicker bar good help,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,quite difficult to get to the top but once you do the view is well worth it be prepared for a cold night as temperature can go down to  degrees celsius or less worth a visit at least  days  night,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,we did the dn starting in sembalun with the ascension to the summit on the st night amazing views and sceneryafter reading the reviews i almost gave up as everybody was pointing out how hard it was and that you needed to be fit it mostly scared me because the fitness level required was pretty vague were a couple of  years old used to be really in shape but university in the last  years has taken up most of our time we are in a ok shape we play squash and go to the gym once or twice a week but weve been better we just told ourselves that it would be the most challenging trek prepared mentally it was really hard but we made it with everybody to the summitmy point dont get discouraged the views are breathtaking so yes youre sore your legs are burning but just a quick look around gives you the courage to go on i highly recommend renting hiking poles as the way down to the lake on the nd day is hard on the knees and it helps a lot in the loose volcanic sandgravel on the way to the summit rent or bring warm clothes jacket gloves and hat because its around  celsius at night and on the summit take good shoes be careful with which company youre booking some like green rinjani are more expensive but its not for nothing we did it with the rinjani trek company which was ok not the cheapest but close but we were a little jealous of the food and camping gear of the other more expensive companiesoverall this trek was the highlight of my  months trip through southeast asia i was tired but loved every minute of it we did take  days of laying on the beach afterwards to recuperate it was a magical experience,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0, hours trekking from sembalun to plawangan last camp before summit hours trekking from plawangan to its peaksummityou can see breathtaking view of segara anak lake from plawanganbut so many trashgarbage in plawangan from unresponsible trekkerporteragenciesalso theres full of human poop seriously in camp areayou must be aware and watch your camp spot before making a tenti didnt use any agenciesi just using  porterswe came in august  ,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,we did  days  night we went until the crater rim the view is wonderful on the crater volcano and the sea i didnt go on the summit  or  days but i find the view is super on the crater so i would say  days is enough for people not being mad of trek the trek is super difficult especially the d day to go down and come back in senaru you use too much your muscles of legs i find that the organization of these treks done by all the companies and freelancers we can find is not really goodthe porteurs are all in flipflops or barefoot they bring stuffs in asian baskets not adapted it would be better if they had mountain bags they have just a tee shirt and a short for the  or  daystheir hygiene is really limitedand they make the food of customersthey do poo everywhereso now there is poo almost everywhere in the forest and on the mountain with toilet papera lot of left camp trashesthere is  worlds in this experience the world of the porteurs and guides and the world of the customers customers have nice tents mattresses toilet tentthe others not the companies could be an effort to give a nice equipment to their employees they work in really bad conditions whereas we pay a lot for these treks around  millions of roupies for  days bosses of companies keep most of the money for themeverybody could have access on the camp to a toilet tent with a hole it would avoid to have poo everywhere companies dont contribute finally to keep a nice mountain without poo and trash everywhereits a shame we pay the entrance of the park but we dont see where our money is used to maintain the parkso hard physical effort nice view beautiful natural site but damaged by people,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,we did the dn hike with sembalun rimsummitlakesenaru rim it was extremely heavy but definitely worth it we also went to the hot springs near the lake price we paid was  million idr per person we booked from our hotel central inn views are amazing although you should focus mainly on where you put your feet,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
2.0,climbing mt rinjani should be the highlight of a visit to lombok but sadly it wasntthe mountain itself is majestic and once you get up to the final ridge the experience is magical with tremendous views in all directions and down into the crater with the lake and the new volcano steaming away the night sky of stars and then the sunrise is truly awesomesadly though the experience for me was completely spoilt by the path up which is heavily covered in rubbish all the way up including lots of plastic bags and bottles and remains of peoples meals the worst bit though is the huge amounts of human waste there is toilet paper everywhere especially near the regular resting points and at the high camp site and it is almost impossible not to step in some as well as being put off by the smell in places so sadif you can overcome this by all means go as the experience on the top is truly wonderful just a shame that getting there isnt,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,beautiful nature and amazing view but nobody talks about all that rubbish up there that is sadthat really needs to stop,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,such a magical place so serene and beautiful at the summit walking through long grass fields on to foggy rainforests up to clear views from the crater rim down to the lake great views of other islands from the summit as well,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,an incredible four day trek to the top of the summit and down to the lake tougher than i had imagined but so worth itbut please do something about the rubbishit is heartbreaking to see mother nature at her best with rubbish everywhere my entire group was very saddened to see such disregard for the environmentplease ensure you and your guides take your rubbish with you,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,we took the days trekking starting from sembalun maria guesthouse the first day you will climb to  meters with is not a problem then you will have short nights get up at around  to climb to the summit at  meters this is a very challenging stage its a lot of gravel and loss sand but when you reach the summit you will have a wonderful view around indonesia,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
3.0,i signed up for the  days  nights tour to the lake rather than the summit after reading about how tough the experience would be online our company was great we signed up to one from gili air and the guide porters and food were excellent and couldnt really be faulted however the trek was ridiculously tough i climbed to everest base camp a couple of years ago and honestly found this to be as tough or even harder at times i really struggled to keep up and found that most people were struggling through rather than enjoying the experience the views are nice but the fact that it is so draining and tiring means you cant really enjoy it most people in my group seemed to feel the sameoverall  sign up to this if you want a physical challenge rather than if you want an enjoyable few days hiking i am still struggling to move my muscles and certainly need a few days on the beach to recover,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,the summit is a must if you have the energy you start early and have a long day ahead of you the guiding composites vary greatly we went with a middle of the road company and were quite happy bring earn clothes and a good sleeping bag if not provided food was quite good too they almost cooked too much for us most days hot springs after the summit are a must a head lamp for the advent in the early morning is a good idea be prepared to get up at am and start on the second day towards the crater this trip is not fit the faint of heart i witnessed some silly buggers wearing sandals the sherpas do it barefoot or in sandles but being done decent footwear i must admit to being child enough on the crater attempt to wearing socks as gloves because it got so cold bring a chocolate bar for some last minute energy too helps you reach the summit,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
2.0,beautiful views and challenging hike so so so much trash and human waste covering every inch of the trail and the camp sites really spoils the trip,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,if you come to lombok you have to attempt to climb this it will be one of the hardest things you do do not enter this naively but it is super rewarding even if you only mange up to the caldera the views are still incredible we did the  day two night tour and that was very intense if you summit like we did prepare for rain even if its blistering hot at ground level that was our only mistake a few bin bags as ponchos and bag covers will suffice also bring an extra jumper as it does get cold on the summit caldera as its very exposed especially with the clouds and wind chill and make sure to tip your portas at the end they are beasts definitely do if you are active and want a real travel experience,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,it was a nice trekking a piece of cake however it was a nice team we had a nice tour guide soba he helped me a lot when i trekking down from the mountain always take good of us for bring food drinks etc our porters were nice too even so it was them job but very appreciated what they have done for us during the trip just few thing to remember good trekking shoe super warm clothes for the night rain coat most important take your trash with you all the way don throw in the nature no matter how,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,i did a two nightsthree days hike up the rinjani it is a challenge dont underestimate how exhausting it can be to climb for hours uphillthe views are of course stunning not just from the summit worth the time and money,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,it was really nice to get experience hike mount rinjani im very satisfied with the service of guider and the porter hope i can see you guys again soon,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,it was tough not easy for first timers it was very challenging physically and mentally too but the view was beautiful definitely worth iti enjoyed the whole trip we changed our scenery for like  times throughout the journey from senaru to peak and down using sembalum way our guide and porters were excellent they were so helpful and served us the best food they can make at the top of the mountain,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,best experience ever and i was plagued with bad weather and didnt see anything from the top do some research before going because i found unprepared people hated it the most its crazy cold at the top i was cold with  winter jackets i did  days  night roughly  hours of trekking pack some gloves snacks and get yourself a stick at the bottom in the forest,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,i did the  days  nights and it was an amazing hike beautiful views it was just a shame that there was trash everywhere it really ruined the scenery and it was hard to see people contributing to it along the way i really appreciated the porters being there and cooking all of our meals i dont know how they do the hike with so much weight it was the hardest hike ive ever done but so worth it,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,the view is breathtaking and the climb  the last mile is excruciating slow the moonwalk that happens saps the energy out of you senaru village to base camp the climb up is easy  downhill some places is tricky base camp to summit the uphill is slow as you moon walk your way up downhill is fun as if skiing worth climbing rinjani i rate the uphill tougher than kota kinabalu,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
1.0,well rinjani was amazing but theres so much trash and toilet paper everywhere its just not worth it go see kinabulu in malaysia theres no trash and they have working toiletsgoogle rinjani and littering issues before you decide to climb itforeigner tourists have to stop climbing until indonesian government seriously start taking care of the rubbish issueif you think its worth going despite you are aware of that problem you are therefore encouraging the hell you are going to see up there enjoy,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,the climb up and down isnt easy the experiance and the view are well worth it though i was amazed by how quickly the clouds move and the view changesbit of advice make sure you look where you put your bag in the dark mine rolled off the rim of the crater and in pretty deep luckily one of the lovely local porters climbed like a mountain got to find it,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,this trek is so so hardwe have an average level of fitness well so we thought after this trek we are for sure hitting the gym before we attempt anything like this againthe views are breathtaking and our guide and porters were really good good food on the trek and we were lucky to be in a nice group of people for the whole trekwe didnt make it to the summit as we did not have proper hiking gear we were  minutes away from the peak but we got seriously cold so if you do this trek bring really warm clothes for the summit walkhot springs and lake were amazing with the view of the incredible volcano you are guaranteed beautiful photosonly downsides was the amount of litter everywhere at the base campsotherwise i feel very proud of myself for finishing the hike my legs and feet kill,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,i bet too many people sang praises to the beautiful trekking experience of mount rinjani agreed  what im going to share is my experience when it was raining during the trekking we were cold but it really helped when hiking the infamous bukit penyesalan no hot sun it also helped to compact the path of volcanic sand to the summit and made the hike to the top easier the tradeoff was we did not get the view of the crater lake at the summit due to heavy cloudsfunny thing i was really glad making it to the top and the crater lake view did not matter much the whole journey was already too magnificent,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
1.0,run do not walk away from the idea of trekking mt rinjani if youre an extreme sportsadventures enthusiast whos at top level fitness and enjoys putting your life in danger then by all means go right ahead and trek mt rinjani otherwise dont do it this mountain is not just hard to climb its dangerously difficult in some areas i did the  day night trek and was mentally done by the end of day   and ive summitted mt kilimanjaro almost every part of this mountain is steep i mean steep and day  includes lots of sliding in loose dry dirtrocks for basically the entire afternoon just when you think you reach the top of a hillnope its not the top youve still got hours to go i decided not to summit on day   day  was so miserable for me and the  hours of nonsummit walking to be done on day  were enough to convince me that was the right decision for me going down was just as hellacious as going up prepare for noodles legs within minutes we walked about  hours to the lake segara anak and hot springs had lunch then had to climb another mountain for  hours to get to that nights camp up on a ridge at  point i couldnt even figure out where my feet should go because it was just dirt on a very steep slope at this point i had to banish from my mind the image of falling to my death like the idiot i was to go on that stupid trek in the first place the guide told us that there was no emergency plan for if someone gets hurt up there and that many porters have died up there like it was no big deal day  was rainy which turned out to be a good thing because it made the loose gravel going down the other side of the mountain a little less slidey this was a  hour walk it wasnt as horrible as days  and  mainly because the end was in sight also dont be fooled by this geopark rinjani and green rinjani crap theres garbage littered all the way up and almost all the way down i saw garbage from cooking vegetable and fruit peels discarded drink cans water bottles gum candy and biscuit wrappersi even saw discarded panty liners at  different points and just in case youre expecting a pit latrine or any type of basic bathroom facilities dont that doesnt exist on mt rinjani the views were great but honestly they werent worth it to me would i go again definitely not would i recommend it i emphatically wouldnt i could have spent  days binge watching game of thrones instead trust me  find something else to do anything is better than this,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam

5.0,we did the dn trek from sembalun to summit to crater lake to senaru to provide some background im a bornandbred singaporean female who could never run a marathon nor would i wish to do so but i do hiits as well as relatively intense hour cycles for cardio so i would say ive some level of fitness for people who are fitter than i am dn is fine for those who are not dn or dn ie skipping the crater lake and going back down the same way up would be better bring windproof outerwear warm layers head lamp hiking stick shoes with good traction blister plastersday  is the trek from sembalun village at about am after registering at the trekking centre mostly savannah so not much shade  sunblock and lots of water absolutely necessary here its still a walk in the park at this point quite pleasant if not for the sunheat it got intense after lunch when we started up the neverending  hills and the terrain isnt kind  quite often its dustgravel on steep hard ground so only the best hiking shoesbeing on all fours will keep you from faceplanting we made it to our camp at sembalun crater rim at about pm nice views all round but being right on the ridge meant it was very windy and got cold quickly after the sun setday  part  we started on the summit climb at am in the morning head lamps are dead useful here so is windproof outerwear and warm layers the first part is quite challenging as its dark and its treacherously steep at some points the ground is also quite slippery i think there was about an hour plus of this then comes the middle part which was a relief as this is the more level part of the ridge and the terrains much better too sadly this was over too soon as we reached the third section  the steep gravelly one step up two steps back part that anyone whos climbed an active volcano would be familiar with this was interminable it did not help that the wind was very strong to the point that i had to prod my hiking stick sideways into the ground for support it was also bleeding cold  i had on a windproof jacket a warm hoodie a turtleneck longsleeved fleece a buff gloves tights windproof hiking pants and two pairs of socks  i was still cold under all that my nose was dripping and my eyes were tearing from the wind but anyways stiff upper lip fig but also lit kept at it lots of people on their way down giving us encouragement made it to the top much after sunrise but the fantastic views and complete feeling of accomplishment are worth it also one plus point of being so slow was that we pretty much had the summit to ourselves for lots of camwhoring the way down was skiing down the gravel plus some bumsliding got a bit dustychoky going down  we were lucky to not experience the dust while going up as it had rained an hour or so before we started the summit climbday  part  we got back to the camp at about am then had to get going after an hour to descend the crater rim for those doing the dn climb they headed back the way they came to return to sembalun for us we were headed to the crater lake jumping and clambering down some steep rocks and crumbly stairs  god knows who put those in  this took about h i think hell on the knees then the next h or so were a mix of steep allfours clambering with flatter walks quite tough considering that wed been up since am to climb it also started to get quite warm lunch at the crater lake popped by the nearest hot springs for a bit quite underwhelming then went a ways round the lake to reach the point to start our ascent to senaru crater rim this was terribly exhausting  hours of mostly steep climbing definitely had to haul ourselves up over the rocks using our hands and legs at many points however the view backwards of the crater lake and baby volcano was absolutely stunning got to senaru crater rim at pm shortly after sunset not as cold as sembalun crater rim as the tents are not pitched right on the ridge so not directly exposed to the windday  the descent to senaru  i found my hiking stick extremely useful but my friends felt that their sticks got in the way we started at about am hopping down some rocks this was relatively fun after about min of this we got to the horrid steep and slippery section where lots of sliding and falling happened and i elected to slide down on my bum really awful this was for about h i think we then reached the forested section  somewhat better here as there are tree roots to form natural steps and its shaded but there are still some steep slippery parts and some very large steps that are also hell on knees plus many curious bees buzzing around the forest descent goes on for very long  perhaps hours adding in h for lunch we got to the pickup point at about  pm bruised toes all round despite our brokenin shoes youve been warned,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam

3.0,my husband and i are experienced hikers and have done hiking trips around many places in asia we would not recommend the dn trip unless you are an experienced hikers with all of the appropriate gear including head lamp hiking sticks warm waterproof jacket and hiking boots if you do not meet these criteria i do not think you will have much fun on this hike it is physically demanding and parts of the hike are very technical we enjoyed the first day of hiking up the mountain and the difficulty level was as we expected from all of the research we had done however on the nd morning as we tried to hike to the summit it rained very heavily and was zero degrees we had brought warm clothes but quickly we were soaked it was pitch black and we were still  minutes from the summit sadly we decided to turn back rather than risk hypothermia our experience is a good example of how quickly circumstances can change on the mountaintop and even for two experienced hikers it didnt work out luckily we had an hour to warm up in our tent and have breakfast before the hike back down which the first two hours were very challenging because everything was wet and quite steep there were some beautiful views marred by the garbage and the stench from the makeshift toilets but on balance it wasnt the best hiking experience we have had,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,trekking from plawangan sembalun to summit mount rinjani at  am on st may  its not easy to climb up just depends on my one and only headlamp the surface of trekking area much like sand i can say the only tips i get from my guide to prevent from one step forward and  step backward he suggest me to follow where the person infront me step on yes it works it kinda chill up there but if you plan to stop and catch some breath please do it but dont stop for too long its gonna be so chill with the wind around am its already sunrise i just enjoy the view from the cliff at am i finally reach the top with some help from my guide the  view up there was so majestic,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam

4.0,very beautiful mountain but not as clean as i expected it to be peope should not litter and carry their own trash,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,climbing this volcano and reaching the summit was incredible and im so glad i did it however i wouldnt recommend doing this in april like i did the rain made it incredibly dangerousas a fitness guide id say most people could climb up to the crater which you can do in one day however to climb the summit at am from m to  metres is extremely hard i made it but i would compare this to a marathon in terms of difficultyits very dangerous in the dark a head torch is essentialdefinitely worth doing but just be careful and maybe avoid going in any month where rain is likely,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,if you look online and at all of the guide sites you will find that there appear to be an endless number of routesdaysoptions for climbing so i will clear that upthere is only one main trail on the mountain this trail has two access points sembalun and senaru the best place to start is sembalun which is where the park station is you must always check in at the park station and get a mountain tagalmost all of the climbs follow the same route and see the same features but can be completed quicker or slower dayhike to rim moderate or hike to summit challenging and back to sembalun day nighthike to rim camp sleephike to summit lake hot spring opposite rim camp sleephike down to senaru day  nighthike to rim camp sleephike to summit lake hot spring sleephike to opposite rim camp sleephike down to senaruthe whole hike is challenging and you should be in good to excellent shape or this hike will be a challenge and possibly not enjoyablethe summit climb which takes  hours starts at am and is extremely challenging and somewhat dangerous the steepness and the condition of the path which is loose stone on volcanic sandash make very tiring the path is flanked on both sides with steep drop offs either of which could cause serious injury or death the summit climb is doable but is no jokescenery is incredible with about half of the hike and both rim cam sites being in or above the clouds mornings are clear and offer amazing viewshere is a summary of the distanceselevations coveredbase to camp  km m startcamp  to summit km m camp summit to camp  km m summitcamp  to lake km m lakelake to camp  km m camp camp  to senaru km m finish,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam

4.0,we made a dn trek to the summit of mount rinjani in april  overall it was a very positive experience thanks to the excellent organisation of the local company we had chosen our friendly and competent guide ihwan our good luck with the weather and because we were prepared well enough for the hard trekking also thanks to the reviews we had readfrom the first email answer on we got from abul we could trust everything would be fine it certainly was for a fair price we got good guidance nice food surely enough of it even snacks proper tent and sleeping bags our guide ihwan or wan number one was enhousiastic about his work took responsibility for us coping with all the difficulties was nice company to talk with our two porters made a huge job in carrying everything along the steep slopes and turned into perfect cooks when not carrying all three of them took conscientiously all the garbage back down ihwan also taking part of the project of cleaning garbage of othersunfortunately in spite of the efforts of many garbage still is a big problem on the rinjani trek and this why the trek itself was not a fivestar experience for us on campsites and at lunchbreak shelters you still can see lots of paper plastic food rests  according to our guide mostly left by independent local trekkers most of the paths are in rather clean condition the lakeside was probably the worst and thats why it was quite good we didnt spend an extra night there although the second day was quite a long oneas for the trek itself the views from the rim and the summit really make the effort worthwhile in this still green time of the year we could also enjoy the scenery during the ascent from sembalun no dust yet and descent to senaru shady forest it has often been stated that the ascent to the summit is a hard job i totally agree but for somebody with trekking experience and good condition plus good shoes and trekking poles it is by no means an impossible task i must say i found the descent from the rim to the lake technically much harder due to rotten steps and awkward stones on the path time for repairing the pathi hope the efforts of the national park authorities and responsible trekking companies like ours will soon have a lasting effect and the rubbish problem can be solved for good in a manner suiting the character of the magnificent mount rinjani all trekkers be sure to check beforehand and during the trek that you choose a company wirh ecological responsibility of course bring your own rubbish including toilet paper down as well,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,mighty rinjani rises  m above sea level there are thermal baths jungle and arid zones all in all amazingi would do it againsome tips you cant climb rinjani on your own you have to do it with an authorized guide some places are really steep and for a long time its not a walk its challenging and you should be reasonably fit to do it it is in some places dangerous so dont do anything stupid,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,this was a totally amazing experience the hike is tough but the views are the best i have seen in my life the company was super professional with a great team of guide and porters looking after you all the way up and down amazing food cooked fresh for you three times a day and comfortable tents and sleeping bags cant recommend this highly enough,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam

5.0,rinjani is great mountainit is not only the summit but also the trekking combination of savana forest sand and volcano stone make it completethere are two normal ways senaru and sembalun to reach the summit beside another one for advancesegara anak lake in the rinjani crater also beautiful especially when some cloud across itto have summit in rinjani please consider the wind speed and time to allow summit in time and safelast but not not least a lot of trash in rinjani all people shall keep rinjani clean by bring down all their trash,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,have to say that we were not prepared for this no proper attire and the rain didnt help eitherif there is an opportunity in future better get suited up,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,when i sat down at a restaurant in senaru for a dinner i heard some conversation among traveler who will climb rinjani in the next morning from their conversation i got an impression that some people are afraid to do this climb they may read their bible guide book which stated that climbing rinjani is not easyto reach rinjani summit from senaru is surely harder than you start from sembalun lawang if you climb from senaru normally you will need  nights stay in the tent and is shorter when you start from sembalun lawang which is possible to stay in the tent  night only and back to this village with the same trackif you start your trip from senaru and finish in sembalun lawang you may start your first day at  am and you need to report and pay the entrance fee dense forest here will make your walk feel comfortable you will have several posts shelter which will give you opportunity to have some rests many climbers with their guides and porters will normally have their lunch in post  after having your lunch you need to continue your trek to post from post  to plawangan senaru lake rim is no more dense forest so you will need to prepare and protect yourself from the heat of the sun you will arrive in plawangan senaru around  or  pm this is a wonderful place with wonderful views be prepared also to take picture of a beautiful sunset with mt agung  bali as a background plawangan senaru is a good place to plant your tentyou may continue your second day of rinjani climbing after your breakfast attention do not be inattentive when you going down from the rim big rocks narrow space to pass through can be slippery your lunch can be done near the lake and you may also go to hot spring not far from the lakeafter lunch the climb to plawangan sembalun is quite difficult and you may climb under the heat of the sun in this situation i prefer if the cloud come to reduce the heat you will arrive in plawangan sembalun around  or  pm and plant your tent here during the night the wind may blow hardly here so make sure your tent is planted wellto reach the summit and also enjoy the sunrise many climbers start from this camp site at  am even i saw many climbers start earlier if you climbed already semeru on java and started to reach the summit from kalimati then i may give my opinion here that semeru is harder but still you need to give your concentration here and imagine rinjani is very popular there are many many climbers here be careful on the spot with narrow space also on the top of rinjaniback to camp site for your nd breakfast and normally you will be surrounded by monkeys while you are having your banana pancake you may go down to sembalun lawang after your breakfast please remember that the forests here are not dense be prepared your hat etc and can be dusty as well your lunch can be done in post  or  or in between depend on your condition arrive in sembalun lawang and selamat,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam

4.0,rinjani is indeed beautiful the trek is full of uphill and downhills would be a bit tiring for people who dont exercise often like me some rest points have outhouses bring your own tissuewetwipeswater to clean yourself after your business as there isnt any its just a hole on the ground no flush system would not recommend going during near monsoon season i was suppose to be there from th but had to cut it short and miss the summit push as the weather was really bad at basecamp and our tent zips didnt work so rain got in and almost everything in our tent got wet including our sleeping bags so it was a shivering night be sure to check weather forecast before travelling and bring windproof waterproof everything proof,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,this mountain is not for the faint hearted its a challenge in so many ways but every step is worth it once you reach the top the rewards for conquering are great mountain is a bit dirty if you go please take your rubbish when you leaveyou can book a guide and camping gear in sembalunallow  days to climbhighly recommended to get a guide and porters,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam

4.0,definitely the most beautiful mountain in indonesia that i ever hike i spent  days and  nights and spent most of my time in segara anak lake with an amazing view of mount baru jarithe sunrise was splendid and the sunset on pelawangan sembalun was awesomebut the hike was tiring my feet was sore for days make sure to bring sunscreen because it is hot during the day and really cold during the night hiring a potter is not necessary but advisablethe drawback was the rubbish its sad to see a paradise contaminated with rubbish and fecesps make sure to have a bath in the hot spring,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam

1.0,to hike rinjani is to contribute to the degradation of the environment i read the reviews before doing so and i thought the trash had to be an exaggeration  i assure you it is not it is so completely sad the amount of feces and plastic bottles you will see all over the trailif that doesnt deter you ill let you know that the trail goes entirely strait up and down i am in excellent shape running many miles a day and i was sore for dayswhen i spoke to some guides about the trash they just laughed this mountain is not sustainable and i wish that no one would hike on it until its cleaned up and a plan is put in place to make sure we protect areas of beauty if people continue to hike then nothing will get done it will continue to get trashed out if tourists stop paying and take a stand to try and fix things then i hope something will change,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,entrance started from sembalun took us dn for the trip and reached the summit  dewi anjanicamped for one nightreview  prepare you physical condition hire porter to take care your thingstentand food dont summit during daylight the heat will drain you this mountain is a sacred place for local people so  dont do anything unappropiate and speak bad word dont take anything from the mountain wear the right shoes,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
2.0,we had expected a little less effort from that trekking it was very exhausting and difficult especially the last hike up to the top the terrain is not easy to walk and a lot of trash is lying around if you catch a nice weather the view from the top is amazing its enough to go for only  days and not for ,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,if your aim is the summit the best way is to do it from the sembalun side thats because from the trailhead you can be at the crater rim in  hours like i did from there officially called pos you are literally right next to the long ridge up to the summit if you were to do it from senaru the first days climb is longer as you start around m lower in altitude and you have to walk more to get to the ridge for your summit attempthowever if your aim is to just see barujari then only do the senaru side you will get only a sliver of a view of barujari from the sembalun side unless you get up on the ridgei was planning to climb the summit but the park rangers scuttled that as barujari was erupting when i was going up so while it was nice to see an erupting volcano i could only get a curtailed view from the sembalun side,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,i will never forget the day trek i did to reach the summitwhat you need to know it will be very difficult even if you are sporty it will be cold and dirty and sleeping in the tents will not be comfortable you will most likely not have much sleep at alli decided to do two days as some friends did  and said that the lake and hot springs were not worth the rd day as they are too polluted i believe  days was enough we were about  and to be honestonly about  of us made it to the actual summit the others all abandoned during the last  hour hike negotiate well your price if not you will be paying a lot more than othersdo not bring children this is not fun for thempositive the view from the summit is beautiful with the colors of the sunrise and in general the landscape is beautiful when hiking all the way upnegative trash everywhereits really a pity,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,this is a deceivingly difficult climb because the majority of the mountain is sandy or crumbling volcanic rock you will end up sliding down however the trip and climb are completely worth it as the mountain lake and active volcano in the region are amazingwe used johns adventures to climb everything went off without a problem,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
4.0,rinjani mountain is one of the best trek destination in south asia and the second high volcano in indonesia to climb the mountain you should have mountain experience and  days  nights trek is the best option for beginner trekkers and please book your trek at reputable agency the are many illegal agent offer special price for all trekking packages but at the end you will have very poor service food camping equipment etc,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam
5.0,i had amazing dn trek in mount rinjani although i went in summer season early oct it was very hot all hill were dry some were burnt the view was very beautiful this is a challenge trek especially for the summit part we had to woke up at am and climbed up to the summit its a volcano and different from other mountain the route is full of dry lava you need to climb zigzag to avoid slide down way down is easier and fun like skiing  hours hiking its exhausted you might see some give up along the way up but the sunrise view is adorable you also able to see the magnificent lake from the top as i have  night camp my nd night basecamp is near the lake its quite relax when lay down in the tent and see the smoke from the small volcano the guide showed me the local route on the rd and th day i was so lucky when no tourist went this way seems its a private route if you love trekking go for it,Mount Rinjani,NTB,Alam

3.0,decided to visit gili trawangan island for something different on our trip to bali the island is ok but very commercialised i found so many shops  way to many people great for snorkeling  diving trips i much preferred gili air as its quieter  less people there are loads of bars  different kinds of restaurants with all types of foods available was a good trip to see the island but once is enough for me,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
4.0,gili t is a great place to come and relax we were on the island for a week and loved that there are no cars we enjoyed the fact that you can hop on a bike and get to where ever you would like to go on the island in a short time we were worried that it would be a little too busy but there are many places to just to enjoy the sand and blue water,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam

3.0,gili t is still very much recovering from the  earthquake nice but needs more tourism to get where the island needs to be we stayed at gili treehouses for  nights our stay was purely for relaxation the gili treehouses are a short bike ride to the sunset beaches beaches on the sunset side were dirty unless maintained by a beach club our favourite was santi beach all in all we stayed during the rainy season and had two miserable days of weather the rest were beautiful  degree sunny days looking out to lombok and bali was cloudy during our nights we heard some incredible thunderstorms it was great to live the island life for  days and really unwind make sure you hire or make sure your accomodation provides bicycles try not to use the horse and carts we spent approx  au per day on food and drink,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
5.0,gili trawangan was first of the  small islands between lombok as its main island and bali the nice thing is as a small island there is no pollution from car and motorcycle as there is only bikes horse carriages and electric bikes here so it is kept naturalthe main attraction i enjoy here is its sunrise and sunset  and how to enjoy in between the sunrise side of the island is facing towards lombok and is the side where boats are at harbour so it is a nice thing to enjoy while the sunset which is very beautiful is at the other side of the island have sandwich and drinks to enjoy the sunsetin between sunrise and sunset a lot of food to taste coffees gelato and many other delicacies biking snorkling and others will push our adrenaline more and be more happy surely at nights there are still a lot of eating and music to enjoy,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam

1.0,this is a nice island a pretty chilled unique but affordable location lots of fun to be had however it has a dark side there are no motorised vehicles on the island sounds cool the major form of transport is bikes and horse drawn carts romantic no the way these little ponies are treated is criminal and appalling they work so hard in extreme heat pulling heavy loads they are whipped yelled at and look in terrible condition its not just a few there must be  plus we found it distressing if you go dont use them for me its a reason to blackball the destination seriously,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam

1.0,attention carefulon the th of january my boyfriend and i took a private tour on this gili boy boat and stole  rupees from our walletwe closed the tour the day before on the central street on the day of the tour we separated  rupees and put it in our wallet because it would be our money to spend the day we left the hotel straight for the tour and stayed  hours between the islands we didnt buy anything during the ride when we returned to gili trawargan we went straight to lunch and to our surprise when we opened the wallet that was in the purse it only had  rupees beware of private tours they took advantage of the moments we were at sea snorkeling to rob us,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam

5.0,such an amazing island most activities revolve around the water snorkeling diving swimming riding bycicles and sunning there are some awesome snorkeling around the island they have put some artificial reefs and objects in the water and there are lots to see including turtles from the beach meals are a little more expensive but hey its an island tip for young players take reef shoes so much coral on the beach,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
5.0,had the best time on this island was disappointed on bali there was just too much going on for us so accidentally found this island and it was so cool no transportation only way to get around is bicycle or horse so if thats your style you will have a blast here fyi there is a muslim mosque that talks on the intercom periodically throughout the daynight so i would suggest finding a place to stay that is away from the city center we stayed at villa pine tree and loved it anyways we were sad to leave there are  other gili islands to explore and them lombok is next door as well lots of snorkeling to do,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
2.0,if you have been to  and some pothead islands there koh lipe etc then you know what this is like pretty dirty no waest management what so ever if it rains the streets or paths are covered in mud did not bother even to take photos our visit was like min and then we told our boat driver to pull up the anchor magic mushroom island is what we named this and quite many others agreed to it when we shared our thoughts back at the resort its just not worth it,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
5.0,we travelled all of the gili islands back in  and decided to return in  as we got engaged here previously needless to say that development on trawangan has continued albeit slowed by the  earthquake we opted to stay on trawangan and visit air whilst snorkeling as it made for a great base we stayed on the chilled sunset side which was the best for us knowing we could cycle to the main town at any time quite quickly it is great to see that the island is starting to respect itself in terms of identity care and ecological issues top tips take in the sunset on a clear day that will include views of mt agung on bali go snorkeling there are many trips to take our you can do it yourself but the locals seem to know the turtle hotspots walk to the summit its only m high but you get some good views over air and meno it is also mostly shaded buy something from hawkers im not normally for this but some goods are hand made and they are nice people up for a chat eat indonesian so many of the restaurants now pander to the west with pizza tacos etc etc but indonesian food is deliciouswe really enjoyed returning and may be back one day but until then there are many other places on our list,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
3.0,i stayed in gili t for  days and while its beautiful it did not me my expectations beach wise if you are interested in diving and snorkeling than this is definitely for you that is the main activity its marketed everywhere on the island and the waters are amazing other than that its just spas western restaurants and beach this is fine except the beaches have tons and tons of coral and broken coral everywhere you simply cannot walk on the sand without shoes even in the water its there along with kelp and algae i really wanted to just be a beach bum for a few days but it was ruined by all the coral i even went to the other side of the island which was worse because it has rocks and coral there are also way too many horse carts constantly going up and down the main strip where all the tourists stay it is a small island where you can walk or bike no need for horse carts there are bicycle rentals everywhere if you dont want to walk around plenty of western restaurants not much local food missing was adequate places to find beverages it is a very hot place with not much shade so you constantly need water but the few marts that keep water and soda are not enough for the climate you dont walk into restaurants in the daytime just to buy water if your interested in diving snorkeling or taking boat rides definitely go but if you want soft sand beaches skip it and go to kuta lombok where they have great beaches,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
4.0,there are only horse carts or cycles for transportation east side of the island has restaurants bars shops and thus for people who like nightlife or more happening places west side of the beach is quiet with few resorts so before booking decide on which side you would like to stay the horse cart takes k idr to travel from one side to other of the islandthe sunsets on the west beach are beautiful so if staying on the east do plan to visit the west beach in the eveningwe stayed for  nights here which we felt were just enough for us cycling around the island early morning was a funthe beaches are not so good especially in morning and noon time when it is low tide,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
3.0,before i travelled to gilli island i pictured this clean amazing island that everyone talks about sadly i found it to be quite dirty unhygienic and not worth the travel although i dont regret our trip i would never travel to gilli again just because of the difficult transport options and the quality of peopleroads there,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
3.0,i thought that gili t was an idyllic paradise if you look at photos thats what you see and imagine its not like that its a bit of a dump in places unfortunately  rickety buildings rubble and waste i enjoyed the nusa islands a lot more i enjoyed the vibe though and the fact that there are no cars is an experience in itself i loved cycling around the island and there are parts that are very beautifulwe stayed on the sunset side which was a mistake as we were miles away from any lifeif the sky is clear you can sit on the beach and enjoy the sun setthe island is much larger than gili air or meno so you have no choice but to hire a bicycle in order to get around i am glad i experienced it but wont go back,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
5.0,if youre a party animal or you just want to relax on the beach then this place is for you its known as a party island but you can also relax away from the party the only thing i didnt like is the horse and carts  they are treated badly and we saw many with open cuts and wounds from illfitting harnesses ,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
1.0,i first visited gili t in  and it was paradise a couple of bars and some bungalows now its a disgrace scamming locals  dirty rubbish tip  truly paradise lost better off going to some tacky resort in bali than coming here corals all gone,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
3.0,amazing island with great potential but unfortunately its very polluted plastic in the water rubbish all over the streets and no work is done to preserve marine lifetourists are touching the sea turtles and stepping all over reef boat operators and guides are not giving any instructions to tourists on what not to do because they have no ideaeveryone is trying to make money and no one cares about the nature resorts and hotels are digging and building throwing rubbish in the sea very sadworst part is the horses that are severely dehydrated in the  degree celcius heat and burning hot sun they look so skinny and mouth frothing all the time i even tried to give a horse some water but the driver stopped me saying that he will need to pee if i did thatunfortunately our tourism as much as its helping the locals to make money its killing their marine life and hurting their horses and polluting their beachesi hope something is done about this because all i see on social media is instagram addicts posting sexy photos of nice beaches and hiding the sad facts about the island,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
4.0,the name is gili island located in lombok  indonesiathe palace very beautiful and also on the islands of gili many activities that can be done by local and foreign touristlets join us and book your transportfree informationwhatsapp  ,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
4.0,arriving here is awesome jumping off the boat onto the white sand was really cool arriving at the tiny little island was and cool experiencebeach wasnt that clean but not gross you kinda expect some old flips flops and empty plastic bottles on most beaches now sadly this is reality hotels keep their beaches clean but public ones not as muchseeing the horses was horrible i love animals and if they had been treated right would have been a great addition to the trip to see these beautiful creatures but they are worked to the bone at times i saw them pulling  people with luggage these horses were tiny too it still amazes me that people are that ignorant to look past such a bad treatmentplace is party at night and more chill during the day we were asked a number of times if we wanted mushrooms weed or cocaine no thanks but they werent pushy so dont let it put you off just keep walkingi agree with other reviews that this did feel like magaluf for aussiesits quite easy to avoid all that though i would recommend snorkelling as the seas are crystal clear we saw turtles a million fish and an underwater sculpture really coolyou can visit one of the many beach bars to watch the sunsets and there were some nice restaurants toowe stayed for  nights i could have stayed maybe one more day and id cycle round the whole island but we just ran out of timewe had fun no drama it is what it is,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
5.0,visited here by chance as we were visiting our godchild and had to take presents from her mother we simply loved it from the horse drawn taxis on arrival to the cycling motor free roadstrackswall to wall sunshine and you are never more than a kilometre from a beach also great yoga venues my personal favourite was the tree house on the north coast,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
5.0,excellent chill vibes and good landscaping the islands were quiet in the mornings and really loved the sunrise and sunset along a side where you can call the place your own for a while,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
3.0,the island was okay but in hindsight i wish i went to gili air as i prefer a quieter scene and think i would have liked the smaller islandthe locals pray five times a day so may be worth asking your hotel how close they are to a mosquespeaker unless you dont mind being woken up at amthe food offered at the majority of restaurants was mostly mediocre western foodalthough i did see a few turtles the vast majority of the coral was dead or dying which was sad ne portion of the islandthe only way for tourists to get around the island is walk bike or horse drawn carts which is sad as i dont know how well the horses are treated even though the island is small took me mins to bike around it i personally would not have been able to carry my luggage to the opposite side of the island as much as i didnt want to support the horse carts there was just no way i personally would have been able to get to my accommodation or back with out them,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
5.0,good area to chill or swim nice beach and not too busy here in the morning but crazy at the night time,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
1.0,we were looking forward to our trip to the island after reading up on it but we were really disappointed there were things that we just could not overlook such as the amount of litter and mess and how the horses are treated working long hours in the heat and dragging heavy carts also there arent many things to do on the island even just nice walks sadly i dont think it is sustainable enough at the moment despite the nice sunsets i feel that it isnt enough to justify coming to the island,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
1.0,we like so many others were looking forward to gili t as a nice spot to chill and enjoy the beach the sunsets are nice on the beach and the sea does look lovely but thats about it power just drops and goes out island wide not all places have generators so black outs are frequent which is not highlighted anywhere everywhere there is rubbish all over the place and the horse carriages are just disgraceful they are used to carry the bags and people around but not given any water kept tied up and held in tiny stables in the centre of the island it is not a humane way to treat animals at all this is not a large island at all so i suggest you simply walk if you come here but do the smart thing and dont bother its not worth the trip bali is nicer and a lovely place to go enjoy yourself instead of the waste that is here,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
1.0,if i could rate less than  i totally would we were really looking forward to travelling to gili t however we were extremely disappointed by the time we arrived we had read about the boat trip onto the island so we knew that was going to be a bit of a bad journey which was ok however once we arrived to the island it sadly looked like the slums its a shame that these people are made to live in such poor conditions the only way to get around on the island is by cycling which is ok or by horse which i thought would be fine to until i saw how they were treated we had about kgs of luggage with us due to travelling across bali and dubai during our trip they chucked this on to a carriage alongside us both and the rider themselves as a couple we only weigh about kg however that on top of the luggage you could see that this was hurting the horses back however you could not drag your suitcases to the resort due to the poor conditions of the road we then saw that even when the horses are not transported they arent even allowed to sit down constantly carrying their rider laying down on the back of the carriage connected to their back we stayed at the kaleydo villas which were lovely they offered free bicycle hire and snorkelling hire which was really helpful however the second you walked out of the resort it was like you had entered another world gili is definitely the australian version of magaluf if you were travelling there for this purpose you would probably have a good time we did however find a newly opened beach club called skinny dip which was much cleaner nicer and more our style i think if the island had more of these places and looked after their own this would be a much nicer place to travel the sand was white on the beach and the water was clear blue which was nice to see however the coral was dead and the snorkelling in egypt is a much better experience during our journey back on the boat scammers were allowed onto the boat from the staff that drove the boat to and from the island when we had arrived back to mainland bali they say that they work for the shuttle bus company and snatch everyones bus tickets from their hands which forces travellers to get a taxi from someone that they work with they were very rude and aggressive pushing people over to get past considering this is such a run down area that only survives from tourism they should have more respect and consideration for their tourists we will definitely not return to any of the gili islands and will be advising everyone we know against travelling there,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
5.0,the gilis are some of the most beautiful islands ive ever seen coral white sands and turquoise seas topped with that laid back island vibe we were lucky enough to visit in the quiet season where everything closes at  and the island takes a breath from what i can only imagine is a crazy place in the high seasonwe stayed on the north of the island and the veiws were amazing with the coral incredible and the wild life exquisite turtles swim past the beach and can be seen by snorkeling off the beachdidnt spend any time on the east part of the island as it was a little busy for us but a bike ride round the island shows that chosing the right location will cater for allsnorkeling trips are plenty from gili t and you can see the water sites of all the islandsgili mmeno beaches look to be the best but not as easy to get to from the main fast boat companies,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
4.0,gili trawangan is very nice island to take a rest nice sunset beach bars but not more then  days its enough,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
5.0,arriving at the gili trawagan is awesome just like you want it to be at an island like that you jump off a boat and then walk to your accommodation because there is no motorised traffic everything is way more relaxed ofcourse it is a tourist spot but you can have a party and the tourist things on the east side of the island but when you go to the west it is way more quiet and you can easily just chill there without annoying tourists the sunsets are amazing btw,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
3.0,we thought since there was snorkeling off shore we would have enough to do there its nice for a few days but if you are not planning on subua diving a few days should be enough people say this is a party island  i would not say that there is lots of restaurants  the beaches are nice  and the snorkeling is good but other then that there is nothing to do  there is no shopping and almost every night the power goes off some places do have genatiors  so be careful some hotels dont have genatiors  there are bikes on the island but there is nothing to see on half the island  its a little more expensive then in bali for food and activities the boats that bring you over work on bali time  so you might be able to leave on time but dont count on it  overall ok for a few days ,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
5.0, rent a cycle roam around the island massages are expensive that in bali mainlaind but still cheaper than my country in bangladesh try out the local street market inside roads have many restaurants you can try it out see the sunset from sunset beach can try the villa ombaks lumbung hut that is traditional balinese hut with open sky bathroom breakfast is very good villa ombak also has free movie screening in the beach at evenings get a good rated fast boat that is big enough to be used for sea transfer do not use karuna jaya stay atleast two whole days in gili t you can fly to lombok airport and take sea shuttle thats duration is mins from lombok to gili t instead of bali to gili t which is hrs of journey depends on your budget then again do not use karuna jaya for sea shuttle donot,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
2.0,we visited as a family had originally booked for  days but left after   beaches were covered in dead coral  the whole island was covered in rubbish  really grotty  and dont even get me started on the horses  one was so heavily overloaded with building materials it collapsed in front of us  really sad ,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
4.0,this small island is an excellent place to relax and enjoy outdoor activities like snorkeling and diving the beaches are beautiful with crystal water but not ideal to swim because there are so many rocksstones so chose a hotel with swiming poolthe most famous tour goes to the underwater statues and to see turtles and its really nice but be prepared to swim to find the turtle the east side has more bars and restaurants options than the west,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
5.0,wow what a beautiful place when we first arrived the boat docked and it looked like a dump we jumped on a horse and cart which is the only transport with luggage and we were taken through what looked like a third world area with no roads to get to our hotel i was genuinely having second thoughts from that point on everything was positive the island is beautiful and picturesque we swam with turtles caught the most amazing sunsets and cycled around admiring the beauty every single person we passed on the island was friendly some young lads at the street market tried to over charge me for a bantang local beer but got their ass handed to them by an elder woman and i was given the drink for free even at night while walking inland in the dark all the locals said good evening while passing this is one of those places that really has its own identity with no traffic and no real roads as such you can cycle around she whole island in about  minutes a bike costs  a day to rent this is not a luxury island and hasnt been over commercialised you really have to appreciate it for what it is natural and beautiful,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
2.0,the gillis firstly are beautifulthe waters are warm  beautiful there are lots of activities to doplease if you do go snorkeling or scuba in the gillis wear the correct coralocean friendly sun block when you do go youll see all the coral is white and dead and its very sad that all we need to do is wear the the correct protection theres a photo in this review of what id recommendwhat can not be overlooked in gilli t is how animal cruelty goes unnoticed the horse arlnd wagons that take tourists up and down the front all day in the sun and heat are none stop the gilli islands are small and you can walk everywhere these cartswagons look cute with their little bells on but please stop and think about the welfare of the horses theyre so skinny youll never see them be given water i didnt see any care or affection passed on to them in my time on gilli t and they work all day and all night the first jingling of bells i heard was about am and they run up and down pulling carts and tourists till gone pm its shocking do not take a horse and cart  you will be contributing to animal crueltythe horses  dead corals actually put a sad cloud over my time on the island of you have a conscience youll eventually feel terrible on gilli t,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam

3.0,an easy island escape from bali no motorized vehicles in the island the main mode of transportation is bike walk or the horse buggy we did find the horses to mistreated so that was sad to see the main drag is busting with lounge bars greenhouses and restaurants you can bike around the island and will take you a good hour or two it gets very crowded with at time popular with the backpackers crowd if you are into water sports snorkeling diving then the island has a lot to offer otherwise not much to do and see,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
4.0,lovely island with nice blue waters  the only downside was the beaches had too many dead corals which made it very hard to swim or walk along  the idea of no motorised vehicles on the island was very appealing you can walk everywhere or even cycle be good at cycling as pathways are quite uneven or covered in sand and youll always be dodging people or horses locals are all very friendly,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
5.0,the island is the most famous amongst the others neighbours a lot of tourists particularly during weekend some busy cafes around where you can find not cheap food or drink take a time to hire bike to see all part of island some white sand beaches something are stunning snorkelling is the most favourite activity for turtles and fishes,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam

2.0,i couldnt agree more with every average poor or terrible review on here on the gili islands if youre not a back packer go somewhere else the snorkelling is great but that only fills in one day the pristine beaches in the photos dont exist the treatment of horses of awful the roads to ride bikes is terrible the list goes on if you do decide to come i would recommend staying a maximum of  nights we stayed  and it was just too long if staying on gili t stay in a resort on the south of the island far enough away fro the hustle but close enough to walk we stayed on the quiet side and it was simply too far,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam

3.0,unless your a diver not much to do here restaurants and party rent a bike rather than a horse taxi because most are in ill health one even collapsed in front of my kids very sad many restaurants food was quite good we stayed at a dive resort not much of a resort but more about divers our bungalow was clean and had a nice bed and hot shower the aircon struggled during the day but at night was very cool its all about the money here seems to be overrun by expat owners making money from diving toursmy kids seen a turtle a few metres off the coast which was an absolute plus for the island and shows the huge influx of travelers havent scared them away good for a short visit,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
5.0,i think this is the best restaurant on the island the place looks amazing bamboo structure as you havent seen before staff are well trained and helpful food is very good with a well diversed menu,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam

4.0,not so pleasant as before the earthquake many nice bars are gone as are some wellknown restaurants the remaining do there utmost to create the former atmosfere still a long way to go,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
1.0,we visited this island with a really high expectations however this has been one of the worst experiences in my life read below to understand the ratingwe decided to hire a tour to discover the  islands and do some snorkeling with the company agus gili bahari i dont want to highlight the details but during the excursion a man died drownedthe island does not have the necessary resources to meet the minimum emergency and none of the staff working on the island has the necessary knowledge or resources the man who died was attended by spaniards french british and australian i really wish you the best of times in the gili but i just want to tell you that if something serious happens you are totally doomed besides that i want to draw your attention to the kind of tourism you are going to find in these islands for the locals you are simply money after the man died the only thing they asked me was if he wore a life jacket so they could recover iti also want to highlight the unsustainable tourism of the islands the center of the island is literally a landfill and does not resemble what you see in the photos in the holiday agencies if you expect to see corals or life under the water i just want to tell you that all the corals are deadthe conclusion is if you really want to collaborate in this kind of tourism and just want to use this review to show a small part of what does not talk about these islands,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
4.0,when we arrived the island seemed a little full on and was quite busy but as we explored and found our way around on bikes the place really grew on us and we didnt want to leaveyou have to get a bike in order to explore properly this allows freedom as it only takes about min around the whole island whilst beautiful above the beautiful turquoise water below the coral is starting to die you will see it washed up on every beach wear beachswim shoes you will need it and chances are you will see turtles on the northern side of the island snorkelling trips are great but very busy we saw all the main attractions in  hours and the guides are well trained the highlight of the island was the sunsets on the western side with happy hour cocktails probably one of the best sunsets ive seen belowif your young and want to be in the mix then stay around the main strips mid eastern side of the island if you enjoy your peace and quiet then either end or western side is good but you will need a bike to get around,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
4.0,while other places in lombok are quiet gili trawangan makes you see a totally different picture my interest is walking around the island especially at weekend you can enjoy a lot of live music the point of sunset is really romantic restaurants there can satisfy different taste different budget it is quite crowded here but i love such atmosphere,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
2.0,stunning nature soft sand and blue water but a lot of people noise bars it is better to look for something more quiet to enjoy nature,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
5.0,this island is so gorgeous you can rent a bike and ride around within an hour or so stopping at cute restaurantsbars as you please cheap options to hire snorkeling gear and explore the reefs and water life we saw all different colours of fish and a massive turtle everyone is super friendly and there is quiet a few things you can do on the island there is a gym too if youre about that gym life and a lot of cheap accommodation options takes about  hours on a ferry from the port of padangbai to arrive onto the island,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
4.0,this is my th time back to gili t and i still love itwe usually come in may but this year augustthe island was packed and i have never seen it so busyplenty of good restaurantsbarssnorkelling off the beach and you will always see a turtlewalk through the central part of the island and interact with the locals who must be so patient with some of the idiots and disrespectful people who visit the islandsomething for everyone but as i siad this time all accomodation was full and the beaches were packed,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam

5.0,we went here for  nights lovely island the boat over was very late and going back was a disaster but the actual island was fabulous we hired a private boat for a  hour snorkeling trip which was amazing also hired the same boat for private sunset tour really enjoyed that only issue was tha sea was cold for us at this time of the year used horse and cart to get around can hire bikes if you want to see the whole island will definitely be back,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
5.0,a great place for a few drinks and something to eat definitely the busiest of the islands but not crowded a good variety of places to stay and activities to do well worth a few days stop over,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
4.0, it was quiet and a proper backpackers place gili meno and gili air were even more quiet now trewangan is busy it is still nice and gili air is more like trewanganthe basics are still there though lovely water and sand just a load more bars and bar crawls etc i must still be a have to see location from bali or lombok mainland,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
4.0,it has a reputation for being the party island out of the three gilis but thats party with a small p considering some places ive been to south east asia as far as i could see the party was on one small stretch on the south east coast of the island and involved five nightclubs and a once weekly pub crawl that was excellently policed there are no motorised vehicles on the island and so getting around is by bike or the terribly overpriced horse and cart before alighting check out how the animal is treated is it panting so much that it shouldnt take another ride is it sweating profusely does it have blisters and sores where the leather attaches under the belly  the driver of cart number  should be locked up his horse had a weeping wound whilst no bikes or cars keeps one sort of noise down you will still likely have cockerels and a mosque if sung well the call to prayer is beautiful the south west is the best part of the beach to relax and snorkle  that said the beaches arent drop dead gorgeous and you do have to traverse some corral to get to the water depending on the tides you can get cheap snorkle trips to some great places including turtle point where youll see the aforementioned turtle some really great restaurants and accommodation for all levels nice,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
1.0,the reviews and pics of this place make it look so magical unfortunately we did not experience this the streets are dirty and crowded the constant smog ruined the horizons and just generally was disappointing maybe we had to high expect get that its a party island my partner and i are  and big partiers and just found this place to be gross,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam

5.0,this is a beautiful island that offers high to low end accommodations and dining on the bustling east side you have many many bars and restaurants many people and many shops on the west side things are most spread out and seemingly more relaxed the west side can get busy at sunset but afterwards should die down you can easily walk or bike around the island booking may be a bit more difficult as not the entire path is paved some parts the sand is too thick to ride through so you must get off and walk the horse carts were a bit annoying with their bells and horns especially since i have heard of abuse to the horses ny the drivers and seeing so many people supporting this type of transportation the only transportation on the island since cars are not allowed also i think the majority of residents on the island are muslim i may he wrong on the religion and because of that there is prayer of the island pa system multiple times of day including  am it woke me up everyday i was on the island but thankfully it only lasts for about  minutes i suggest eating at the night market at least once and getting a pizza at regina pizzeria having drinks at santi lounge restaurant and breakfast or lunch at hello capitano if you are looking for a place to stay i suggest kalua boutique bungalows a bit pricy for the island but definitely worth it,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam

5.0,escape the traffic on the mainland and enjoy this beautiful island you can book a tour for k to visit the three islands and do snorkeling its worth it but in case you dont want to pay for snorkeling there is a lot to see next to the beach take your own snorkeling gear and water sandals with you but be careful not to step on the growing corals and i prefer to take the public boat its a lot cheaper and funnier and there is only a few minutes difference to reach the island but if you are on holiday you have time no,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam

5.0,this island has all the ingredients to be the perfect beach destination sugary white sandy beaches turquoise waters great marine life fabulous eateriesi had the best snorkeling experience here till now the guide took me to a great spot for snorkeling where i can see turtles and various shoal of glittering fish amidst the corals and further ahead was a deep depression in ocean bed and felt that i was just on the edge of an underwater cliff giili t is known to be the party island we can party late into the night at numerous cafes and pubs on the beachthere are plenty of restaurants providing good foodits a bit costlydont just go for a day trip spend few days on this great island,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
5.0,this is a very interesting experience theres no motorised transport allowed on the island so its either walking cycling horsedrawn cart or the occasional electric scooter but the island is small enough to walk around in about an hour anyway so having a car would be overkill the food is also excellent,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam

3.0,this island is absolutely amazing if you are a backpacker i spent half my time wishing my younger days of wanderlust and free travelling werent over but sadly in your s there are just some places that you are too old for this is one of them its a lovely island but its not a classy and sophisticated place its a shabby sort of place full to the brim on  year olds doing their scuba courses and drinking the night away i would say that only around  of tourists on the island are over so if youre a young backpacker hit this place up on your travels if not i would maybe suggest only a couple of days or maybe not at all,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
5.0,how to go from bali to gili twe have booked one of the best deals we advise you to do the same my wife and were staying in kuta so we decided to visit the gili islands and lombok as we have spent  days in bali and visited most of the attractions there so we looked for and agent on the beachwalk street found a good one haggled and got a round tkt including pick up and drop off to our hotel for kperson and thats one of the best rates you can find just haggle to get the best pricethe agency picked us up and dropped us to the harbor our speed boat was arriving back from gili t we showed the tkts and jumped on our seats it was a bumpy trip but exiting dont worry if will sea sick it will pass away once you land on the shorethe islad is beautiful full of cafes bars restaurants and hotels you need to book your accommodation in advance i recommend airbnb or booking do not book less than  nightsthe island has no cars no motorcycles only bicycles and horses you can easily rent it there the bike is for  usddaythe highlight of the gili t is its magical sun set as you see the sun sinking in the ocean its stunning and sooo romanticyou will be offered weed there my advice do not buy it even if you are a pothead its a scam some tea leavessome bars will offer you a magic mushroom shake if you want to try it do it on the second day of your trip  hours before the sun set then find a spot lay back with your partner and enjoy the seven colors of the sun set as it gets dark you can walk around to the east side some small parties are taking place or you can watch a movie in an open air cinema right on the beachas for alcohol beer is good as ppl drink it we dont advice any local hard liquor its not goodi highly recommend gili t if you are visiting bali or lombok,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
5.0,cool small island with a chill out mood in the morning and party at night the island is actually very small we walked around the whole island in about  minutes it doesnt really have a beach with smooth sand rather it has a coral shore more suitable for snorkeling or diving the east side of the island has all the energy and action while the west side of the island is calm and perfect for watching the sunsets there are nothing motorized here so people walk ride bicycles or ride horse carts everything is actually very near within a short walking distance,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam

3.0,we visited gili t as part of a  gilis trip arranged by our hotel the island only uses horse and carts and bicycles no cars and scooters which is a welcome sight on a tropical island you can get a horse and cart taxi to take you somewhere or hire a bicycle we hired a bike to cycle around the island which cost about k idr but prices will probably varygili t is a popular place for lots of tourists but it was clear once we walked off the beach that this island was more suited for backpackers or those wanting a partystyle holiday there are bars all along the roads the island was sadly not very well kept there was lots of litter and rubbish dumped on the side of the road and the odd statue made out of beer bottles didnt lend itself to a particularly beautiful bike ride around this tropical island the hostels and places to stay that we saw looked quite basiceven though the locals told us this was the party island and it gets very busy it was sad to see it so unkempt and rubbish not being disposed of properlywe managed to cycle around the entire island in about an hour although some parts we had to walk with our bikes as it was too sandythe other gilis were much nicer,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam

2.0,we had high hopes for gili trawangan however it really failed to meet expectations getting back to mainland bali was a nightmare due to large waves and our quick boat not being able to cross we were made to endure a  hour ship ride back which was quite simply awful the food is no where near as fresh as the mainland and service is quite backward and slow unfortunately i wouldnt recommend visiting gili trawangan and wouldnt return,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
5.0,i have been to more then  countries and have traveled all over bali this place is amazing i love that there are no cars here and you can watch the sunrise on one side of the island and take a  min bike ride to the other side and see the sunset very relaxing if you come you must scuba dive plenty of places do certifications must check out blue marine dive center awesome people best dive shop for sure they pay close attention to detail if scuba is not your thing can paddle board or snorkle and sometimes even get done good surf,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
5.0,we visited gili t for our honeymoon as we wanted somewhere relatively quiet relaxing and somewhere weve never been before the island is beautiful with clear blue waters and white beaches the locals are friendly and if you dont fancy cycling you can walk the island in a couple of hours  we recommend this as you can do it at your own pace there are no cars so transport on the island is by foot bike or horse bikes are scattered across the island and most hotels provide them you can jump on a boat to visit the islands which is about  minutes and a private boat from lombok to gili t took around  minutes the weather is hotter than you think so pack a high suncream than normal  you are on the equator after all lots of bars and places to eat too serving local foods and drinks as well as international if you get the chance to visit the island please do its stunning im gutted to be leaving,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
4.0,great island to visit i prefer the gilis to bali with their great beaches snorkeling and food options my biggest complaint is all the trash around the island and in the water with locals and tourists doing little to clean up please bring a reusable water bottle and opt out of getting straws single use plastic items if youre looking for a place to party this is it for families and a quieter time cleaner conditions gili m or gili air are a better choice,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam

5.0,what an amazing island the sunset was spectacular and the majestic sound of the call to prayer added to the spiritual feel of this place cant wait to return,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
3.0,we visited gili t as part of a month holidayhoneymoon around thailand and bali weather was great food an drink was cheap and the island itself is really nice it just wasnt what i had been told it was by friends who had been there previously i know there was an earthquake last year which has probably played its part its a nice island with some good bars restaurants and beaches but for the travelling it takes to get there i would give it a miss next time probably also we have woke up this morning to a text message off our bank we used a credit card for our whole trip just for insurance purposes and while we was staying in gili we tried to take money out of an atm one morning we had previously had no problem using atms on the island but this particular morning it processed the transaction without giving us our cash the money was credited back to our account so we thought nothing of it but this morning someone had tried to make  transactions from our account after speaking to the bank they have told us our card has been cloned by the atm machine and someone has now been trying to withdraw money if this happens make sure you contact your bank asap and keep an eye on your online banking or transactions luckily enough our bank recognised it as fraud and didnt allow the withdrawal and have cancelled the card all in all a nice island and a good part of our trip but that makes the experience a little bit sour now,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
4.0,out of the  gili islands  gili t is clearly the hip and happening one with loads of pubsbars no wonder they call it the party island the other  gilis are quiet and with less crowd please note that gili t is still recovering from last years earthquake and debris and litter is still lying along the roadsgili t has beautiful beaches i enjoyed chilling at mambo beach club which is at the northeast end of the island one can easily swim from shoreabout m in and snorkel to see sea turtles and marine life beautiful but only if you have good stamina to fight the currents to swim back and if you are a very good confident swimmermoving around the island on the rented bikes was very convenient and economical can always cycle to the west part of the islandabout km from italianjob on the main strip to catch the sunset  there are also many ocean swings along that coast which are great photo opportunitieswe took a private snorkelling trip for hoursexcluding lunch which came up to about usd free and easy this will cover gili m and gili a waters too if you wish to have more time on each island  pls discuss with the boat captain and top up accordingly best discussed before the trip starts i had chosen awi from gili bahari snorkelling tourshad an amazing massage at pesona beach resort  azure spatransport suggestions from lombok airport i took sudin transport company which had arranged for us return private transfer from airport all the way to gili t main jetty and back from gili t main jetty to my hotel in lomboksennigi for about usd i agree it is on the pricey end but it was convenient and there was no waiting for scheduled speedboats and the driversboat captain was very helpful if you are on budget  pls find those blogs online which will be useful to figure out your way from the airport to the lombok ferry terminal and the scheduled boats,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam

2.0,gili t has the makings of a successful holiday island but the reality is a situation of dying corals due to global warming and earthquakes and over populated snorkeling spots fishes are scared away by the numerous number of boats even in off peak season and poor planningthe touted party island probably got its name from the countless number of drug dealers offering their product as nightfalls the clubs are dismal bad music although theres no cover chargethe island does serve drinks that are stronger so cheap drinks is a plus herethis island isnt expensive its probably pretty affordable if you book your hotels in advance but if youre tight for time you could give this island a pass,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
1.0,we were recommended to visit the gili islands by a number of people one described gili t as paradise we were shocked to find that it is anything but the amount of litter and mess here is appaling nobody is looking after this island and it is a great shame we walked around the island expecting that away from the busy bars and restaurants the island would become more idylic when in actual fact it gets worse and worse it is not beautiful or paradise in the slightest absolutely not worth the long journey to get here the only places that i have enjoyed on the island are the santi resort ponte villas and pearl or trewangan which are all close to each other very disappointed and would definitely not recommend a visit here it is also sad to see the horses pulling carts around with lazy tourists in its very hot for them and they didnt have watersome were lame we also saw horses being forced to go in the sea up to their necks in water just for someone to collect an inflatable flamingo the horse was trying to turn around but was hit and hit not my image of paradise,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam

5.0,gili t has a bit of a reputation as a party island but we found it really relaxing and chilled out its well worth doing a snorkelling day trip during the start of your trip ours was k pp to get acquainted with the other islands too we were glad we went with gili t  not too quiet not too busyhighlightsturtle point toward north of island where you can swimsnorkel on the beach get up and close with turtles and if you swim out a little further see some awesome coral and fish i did see a couple of jellyfish so would recommend surf shirtpants for protectioncats everywhere and the friendliest cats youll meet gili t is a bit of a cat island and many seem to be well cared for by cats of gili be sure to stop by their shop and support them also worth buying treats for the local catsstreet food market at night  you can pick up cheap and delicious eats that are super authentictipsif you intend to bike around the island just note that a lot of the north part of the island is just sand and not path so youll be trekking through quite a bit of beach to get aroundthe boat ride to the island even though it is fast boat can be really hot and unpleasant if you can try booking a boat with aircon like eka jaya,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam
2.0,alas me being here does not help but i came to these islands in  and the difference now is unbelievable you can now cycle all the way around and there is hardly a single area that is not built on bars and dive huts and boats and people are everywhere this has led to the entire coast line having around  foot of dead coral to cross before you see the fish the turtles are still here but the other wildlife is dwindlingfreshly caught fish is now at an absolute minimum with the vast majority being shipped in frozen from lombok the only fresh caught fish was baby lobster and prawns please do not eat these as it will only encourage the depletion of these stocks furtherthat said there are still turtles here  they return to the same beaches every year to lay eggs and fish to swim with when you swim out far enough and i am sure for a party island this is great to be aton the whole though it is dreadfully sad to see and i imagine within the next  years this island and the close by g air  g meno will be destroyed by over tourism,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam

1.0,i visited this island in  during my travels around asia and was one of my favourite places however im afraid gili t has taken a massive turn for the worse lets start with that horrible overheated lung wrenching fume filled boat from the bali mainland overpriced and not nice at all gili t itself was hit by a  earthquake in  and simply has not recovered buildings have turned to a pile of rubble and those that are still standing seem to be on their last legs litter is everywhere all over the island whether it be on the beach in the sea or into the centre you cant help but get annoyed at something that should be dealt with it seems tourism became too much for this small island i have read other reviews on gili t with people saying how the horse drawn carriages on the island are great to reduce noise and air pollution these reviews left me baffled at how people think horse drawn carriages are the answer what i seen was animals being abused while working in the baking hot sun without any water food or shade i felt physically sick every time i seen one what i would say is yes gili t is great if you want a party even to see turtles and grab a sunset pic on the famous swings however apart from that gili t left me sad knowing that the environment local people and animals are the ones suffering my second and last time to the unsustainable gili t,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam

2.0,the gili islands used to be beautiful but they have been destroyed by their own success the daily boats from bali deliver people to these islands and there seems to be no oversight or thought to the environmental degradation that is occurring the once pristine reefs were filled with fish and colorful coral and you could simply swim out from the beach and snorkel now the coral is mostly brown or bleached white boats anchor everywhere the fish are mostly gone the saddest part though is the garbage just beyond the wall that separates the main road trash has been piled up the beaches are okay but its busy with a lot of people on bicycles that are not necessarily driving sober i saw a couple of accidents if you want to party this is the place to do it further away from the port it is quieter but not necessarily cleaner there are plenty of dive shops restaurants and bars but they have failed to restrain development and its a bit of a mess i was here many years ago before it had been discovered and it was so lovely but its been overfished its not paradise lost but paradise has been found also this island sustained some pretty heavy earthquake damage so the clean up and rebuilding are ongoing you can still snorkel from the beach and im sure the dive shops have special spots but i would not recommend this island,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam

1.0,while gili t itself is quite pretty with beautiful beaches i could not get passed the extreme animal cruelty the only means of transport in all of the gili islands is bike or horse and the horses are actually a single small pony carrying loads of often  people and luggage whipped and beaten underfed etc a quick google will give you all the facts we only stayed for three days and while id love to come back i simply wont until the island considers a more sustainable form of transport solar powered tuk tuks have been proposed,Gili Trawangan Island,NTB,Alam

3.0,there is no entry fee to these waterfalls however be warned that there are many locals asking for a fee to be your guide there is no need for a guide at all especially the first sendang gile waterfall there are stone steps all throughout and its fairly easy to get to it on your own there is only one direction down the steps get steep in some areas when you climb back up so if your elderly or have difficulty you can just slow it down when we arrived our driver brought us to the locals who were asking for  rupiah to take us to the  waterfalls we were shocked as we read that they were free entry they said all kinds of things such as dangerous animals will get lost etc we finally agreed for around  as they said tiu kelep is difficult to find when we went there were so many tourists and none of them had a guide sendang gile is straight down about min tiu kelep is not its about min more and you do have to go through some ankle deep water but if your experienced this will also not be anything to you the waterfalls themselves were lovely and if you like nature and hiking then you will want to visit these just dont get sucked into locals trying to make money off you,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,no need for a guide as long as you are healthy and relatively fit you do not need a guide to take you to explore the waterfalls smile nicely at the guides waiting at the top of the steps pay the  entrance fee but a coffee from the refreshment place and set off on your walk,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,great little walk needed a guide for peace of mind but could do without saw a huge lizard on the way which was awesome definitely a must do,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
3.0,was a bit disappointed as the guy we booked with mohammed told us it was only a  minute walk to the waterfall when in fact it was more like  minutes there is nowhere to swim in this waterfall you can stand near it and get wet from the spray but that is all also lots of steps to climb on the way out we didnt go to the second waterfall as that was another minutes further on and apparently during the earthquake rocks have fallen into the pool thus making a very small pool to swim in there are other waterfalls on lombok that you can swim in  go to those instead ps i have a bad ankle that is why the walking was an issue,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,sedang gile is the easiest waterfall to be reached just walk down the stairs you can see the glimpse of water keep walking down you will reach the waterfall it is so prettytiu kelep is not easy to access due to some ruins after the earthquake assisting by tour guide is recommended if you plan to visit tiu kelep due the damage path,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
3.0,my wife and i thought it would be nice to go see the waterfalls it took about  ish maybe a bit more by car from senggigi to get to the waterfallswe arrived at the drop off which was at a restaurant before the walk to the waterfalls the view from the restaurant was incredible very picturesque we hired a local guide to take us to the falls we like our guide it was great to have someone to ask questions to and his english was goodit took us about  mins to get to the first small waterfall it was ok a nice place to take a few pictures then we went to the other main waterfall it took us about mins to get there make sure you wear closed in shoes sneakers or something not slip on beach shoesthere was an earthquake in august  and it was quite bad the path to the falls has clearly been impacted in certain areas and be had to do a bit of climbing and balancing over rocks logs etc it was a little bit of an obstacle course in placeswe arrived at the falls it was nice but for the amount of time it took to get there we didnt feel it was worth it there has clearly been some damage made from the earthquake and the pool at the bottom of the fall in full of rocks that came downif youve never seen a waterfall before then you might like it but if you have seen some else where in the world tasmania north western australia new zealand etc etc then you might will be a bit disappointed and underwhelmedwe personally wouldnt recommended it ,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,we visited here on a day tour with our driver who had prearranged a guide which was great as it feels great to support the local community as we they are rebuilding after the earthquake beautiful lush surrounding we seen a monkey and felt like an adventure making our way over logs and rocks recommend moderate level of fitness as there are stairs on the way back up we did the trek in jandals and totally fine,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,we went here in the morning at about am and had an amazing time we spent a few hours here the waterfalls are so powerful and it was incredible to get so close i am not sure what people are talking about when they say entrance fee scam we walked to these falls which is about  mins from our hotel we got to an official looking entrance which said  rupees per person there is talk of some fake entrance but im not sure what people are complaining about we were not bothered by anyone and the route was straight forward to follow we were able to enjoy everything at our own pace perhaps some people are just easily led my advise in indonesia is if people are aggressive or forceful in selling you something it is because they are just trying to make money and you just need to ignore them these falls were definitely a big highlight of our trip and should not be missed if you are in the area,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,the water fall is really good right to the place people do really keep an eye about their clean so its good attraction to do in lombok to see more about tropical and forest inhabitants,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,fantastic day trip great guide and driverthe total hike takes about  hours to and from the falls difficult terrain in some parts but relatively easy for most people the falls are spectacular and we saw both black and grey monkeys and lots of birds the only downside is there is quite a bit of plastic and rubbish around on some parts of the trail which take away from the beauty of the jungle,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,visited the two falls good hike just under km there and back different terrain to walk on big drop off side enjoyed it,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,we took a day trip from sengiggi and had read of scams on arrival so were well preparedour driver seemed nice on the  hr drive but then parked at a restaurant and told us when we got out that we must pay a guide to go to the fallsthere was a local man standing there and we told him we prepared to go on our own  then thn both got really angry and said we must paywe had no idea where to go so just walked away up the hill only to find an entrance and path about  metres on the left where you enterwe brushed aside more guides wanting money to escort us and went to the ticket windowto be fair we were told it was k to enter but the path was dangerous to the nd waterfall and we needed a guide we just paid the k and told him we would only go to  waterfallafter viewing that which was down a lot of steps and not very impressive we decided to take the path on the left on the way back up where everyone and their guides seemed to be going upwe spoke to several people coming back from the fall who also didnt have guides who said it was  mins up the riveryou can just follow the river until the end which is the fall but you have to go in it and climb rocks and logs its not hard tbh and a nice walk and scramblethe fall is well worth it much better than the first oneyou can follow the river or tag along behind other people with their guideyou dont need a guide but others have said to support the local peole who lost all their homes in the earthquake so if you feel generous get a guidewe didnt like the way the driver set us up as we had paid him a lot of money for the waterfall trip and resented paying more  he should of paid the guide imhoid say aound k for a guide is about right  not sure why it is per person as entrance is k eachmake your own choice but dont pay more than that,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,the afternoon before the trekking i went to see these two waterfalls with a guide it took less than  hours for both the water falls down strongly so you can enjoy the fresh bathing at the first waterfall for me the second one is more impressive the rainbow under is very very awesome,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,a nice short walk to both waterfalls m to the first and m to the second but would recommend a guide instead of venturing alone heading alone is fine as well but there are some parts of the path which could use some local guidance simply for safety reasons,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
3.0,first we passed the right entrance and came a little further on a parking lot where a guy tried to rip us off he said that the entrance was destroyed by the earthquake but the path was still intact he had no tickets but asked for money of course unfortunately other tourists believed him and paid him we were suspicious and searched for the entrance we missed the right entrance is the one with tickets and you dont have to pay for a parking ticket scooter hit the button if you find this useful thanks and enjoy,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,i went there with my husband and  yr old kid we had nice indonesian lunch just at a warung near the ticket counter the cost if ticket is  idr per person we took diding as our guide he was not only superb but offered to carry our baby throughout the treacherous terrain i paid  for three of usmore than what i promised simply because diding made us to the top with our toddler wear sturdy shoes waterproof back pack as you may get wet in the mist of the tiu kelep fall the hike is no doubt very much engaging amongst the volcanic rocks and water streams you will get great natural scenic views we also happened to see the  in the waterfall awesome nearly  hours ride in the car from sengiggi along a picturesque views of mountains meeting the oceanevery bit worth your time,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,these waterfalls are impressive and well worth a visit when entering we met local people offering to take us down to the waterfalls for  idr which were clearly a ripoff both are quite easy to access on your own just follow the signs from the main road and walk downwards to reach the smaller waterfall,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,do not eat at warung galang ijo it is located on the right side of the main road before the entrancegot ripped off menu on the wall do not have pricelist we ordered lalapan ayam bakso urapurap and  coconut water single portion each bill was pricey k idrguide quoted us k idr per person finally agreed on k idr for  of uswe did tiu kelep first challenging path through stream boulders from the last earthquake were everywhere waterfall was breathtakingsendang gile was next smaller but still interesting,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,this waterfalls are one of the best ive ever seen in my life you can check it out if you search for waterfall in lombok,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,we visited the sendang gile waterfall one day before climbing to mount rinjani this waterfall is truly amazing,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,went here after hike is the best you can chill here and take a bath on sendang gile but you can only see tiu kelep from afar btw i went to hike mtrinjani with rinjani foundation if you wondering,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,this is  to  minute walk away from the road you walk on a narrow path on the edge of a mountain then walk down about a hundred steps to the waterfall your efforts will be greatly rewarded a real must do the place was tranquil and picturesque it is safe for normally mobile people i would only take children who are obedient and can walk in a straight line as the track in areas is only a meter wide with a descent drop beyond the grass and shrubs,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,a decent drive from senggigi but definitely worth it we paid k for  people for the  hour drive there and back plus stopping at some sights on the wayyou dont need a guide but it helps the track to tiu kelep is damaged in a few spots and completely covered by landslides in some others id suggest sensible shoes but i saw people doing it in thongs just be aware some of the rocks are slippery and you will get wet if you get closea must do if youre visiting lombokpics show the landslides where the path used to be,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,this is by far the best waterfall ive ever seen in my entire life its so huge and its so raw just wow,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,it was beyond my expectation freakin love it i was so majestic you can see small rainbow there below the waterfall,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,we travelled from senggigi to check this outa little nervous after some of the recent post earthquake reviewsbased on advice we got a local guide and bartered down to k per personthe hike to the first waterfall is an easy  minute stroll down some stepssendang gile is nice you can take a shower in one of the many additional flows and get some nice photos theres a food stand toilets and seating and plenty of monkeys lacking in fear a little rubbish around as always seems to be the casea lot of reviews wildly exaggerate the additional walk to tiu kelep is  to  minutes at best not an hour if involves some shallow wading and scrambling over rocks and logs but is easy and low impact children can do it as could our guide in flip flopsthe waterfall is impressive but has been affected by the recent quake with no pool to swim in remaining i dont think youd want to either as low level rock falls still appear to happen with large rocks littering the path that would be bad news if they landed in your headour guide was friendly and engaging and i would recommend one just because the quickest and safest route to tiu kelep since the quake is unclear and not signposted the old route blocked by landslidesthe price is reasonable and i was more than happy to pay and leave an additional tip especially after hearing how the guides house was destroyed by the quake and he has been living in a tent and trying to rebuild his house whilst doing these tours to scrape by enough to live and eat the impact is particularly evident when you see the state of senaru which is like a ghost town with hotels reduced to rubble deserted trekking shops and abandoned restaurantsdont be put off be generous and support the area to get back on its feet while getting some moderate exercise and appreciating nature win win,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,tiu kelep is a powerful and raw waterfall you will definitely feel the true life of nature no food stands no trash at the waterfall it truly is one i will remember for a long time this one is less travelled than sendang gile which is also nice,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,sendang gile is really great one but continue to the tiu kelep its even more amazing this picture is from tiu kelep,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,we took a tour to these waterfalls and since the earthquake last year there is visible damage as trees have been uprooted and the path is a nice little hike the structure of the tiu kelep waterfall has changed as there is no longer a pool to bathe in at the bottom however it was absolutely amazing and i am glad that i had the chance to see it and i am assuming that we were the only ones there due to the fear of another earthquake i am glad that i had the opportunity to do it now because im the event of another earthquake who knows what will be left of this magnificent structure,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,we were told that the waterfalls and especially tio keleb are not recommended at the moment because of the damages the recent earthquake has caused but for some unexplainable reason we decided to go there anyway met a nice couple at our hotel who also wanted to go so we took their recommended local guide and went all together i would say especially now after the earthquake a guide is definitely needed the hike was ok and manageable even with a decent fitness level as mine it took a total of  hours for both waterfalls tiu keleb is my favorite so beautiful and graceful and yet very powerful our guides had told us that we really could just look at it and turn right back around which we did their uneasiness made us a bit nervous too in my opinion you should never underestimate the power and unpredictability of mother nature but if the waterfall is a bucket list item for you like it was for us its gonna be worth the nervousness and the subtle fear especially at the spot where the malaysian tourists and their guide were killed it literally turned my stomach around thats why we decided not to pose for any pix but just take the beauty of the nature in and got out as quickly as possible the entire trip was free but we decided to tip our guide well since he made it happen,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,our local guide has led us to the waterfall eddie  not far from the rice terraces quiet place,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam

5.0,amazing waterfall ever in lombok this so great to visit as a soft fun trekkinglove itdo not forget to bring action cam,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,went there with a trekking company guide my jaw dropped after seeing tiu kelep waterfall very recommended,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,took a  hour car ride to reach the entrance of the waterfall in the national park we were greeted by a young guide who helped us with our towels it was a quick  easy walk down to sedang gile we walked all the way down to the pool below the waterfall the water was nice  refreshing continued with a mins track to tiu kelep the track was more challenging but still doable my  year old girl   year old mum did it with a little help from our guide all of us did not regret the effort taken to reach the fall the sight was majestic,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,the first waterfall is an easy short trek on the main path and is beautiful downside is the rubbish found on the trail tiu kelep the second waterfall requires you to go on a bit of an adventure crossing streams and over logs its fun our  year old had a ball and its well worth the effort tiu kelep and the surrounding jungle is breathtakingly beautiful she is powerful and majestic definitely one of the most amazing waterfalls we have ever seenin regards to the locals trying to scam you to pay to get in and for a guide it is out of control and needs policing you do not require a guide if you are fit and able however if you have young children i would recommend paying for one to help with the trek they are really good at taking care of the children ours did but bargain hard walking away normally gets them lowering there price quicklyi certainly dont mind paying to enter the national park or for a guide if i know the money wasnt a rip off and that some of the fee went back into education awareness and preservation of this natural wonder,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,it is good to combine these with a trek to rinjaniplease make sure you bring good shoes the first waterfall can be reached easily the second one you have to go through deep water and it is quite an adventurous hike if you do not expect it from the first to the second waterfall it is more than  minutes hiking,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,our trip from mangsit at the resort where we were staying to the waterfalls and back took the whole daywhen we got to the national park entrance we stopped at the neighboring restaurant for lunch and had a nice meal with a beautiful view of some rice terraces in the distance as well as a mountain ridge with some waterfalls across the wayafter lunch we met our guide our driver introduced us and his friend they were very friendly and made our experience of the waterfalls much more enjoyable the reviewers saying you dont need a guide may have originally been correct but since the earthquakes in august  the way to the second waterfall tiu kelep is a lot trickier to navigate and involves climbing over fallen trees crossing the stream and up and down a few steep hills created by landslides it made getting to the waterfall that much more satisfying and it was beautiful with the pool of water at the base of the waterfall being quite nice to swim in we did not end up swimming that day and headed back after taking some pictures tiu kelep is well worth the effort but definitely requires a guide if youre timing is good you could follow another group with a guide but this is a little bit dishonest whether or not a guide is mandatory as some have claimed i believe it is nice to support the local community the guides dont charge much anyway and after you see the devastation the earthquake has caused on the drive up how could you not want to do something however small to help the area recoverits uncertain when they will be able to fix the path to the second waterfall but until then you have to be in decent enough shape for the obstacles in the way the guides will assist by helping you carry your things and hold your hand while jumping down from rocks or crossing the moving stream which is yet another reason to have them therein all with driving guide and entrance fee the experience cost us about k ruppiah for  people well worth it and i look forward to coming back one day i wish lombok a speedy recovery in the meantime,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam

5.0,so youve gotten dropped off at lomboks new international airport and you want a place to stay so you decide to go to central sengiggi there are many things that lombok boasts from lovely clear beaches to mountainous terrain there is one place that you should go and that is the waterfalls at the base of rinjani lomboks volcano in the northern part of lombokthere are two waterfalls that are accessible from a gangway at the entry costing around  aud for  tickets sendang gile  tiu are easy to get to walk through the self guided paths built against the mountain and follow it youll come to a junction one way left goes to sendang gile and the other right goes to tiusendang is easy to access as the main path leads to the first waterfall at the end of the path youll find small stalls selling food and a little walk off if you want to take a shower sendang is a moderately sized waterfall falling onto a natural pebbleised floor the mist is light and the waterfall falls pretty heavilytiu is harder to get to as the path is not concreted like sendang youll go through paths usually dirt that naturally direct you to a waterway climb the steep steps follow the paths through the river and youll eventually get to tiu make sure to wear decently ridged shoes youll get to tiu and youll have to place whatever you have in open space because there is no designated bag area because it hasnt been touched by construction ever the area is a deeper lake with a massive over  foot waterfall its nice and secluded and cleani suggest this to be one of your bucket list adventures,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam

5.0,on july   lombok encountered a  earthquake the epicenter was approximately  miles km away from these waterfalls the hiking trail is rugged and follows primarily a manmade aqueduct part of the tour that guides often take you through is an aqueduct tunnel built into the hillside i would highly advise against utilizing this tunnel due to the instability of the area and potential for landslides as well as the unsupported nature of the tunnel you are also required to hike across the aqueduct bridge which may have sustained seismic damage i saw the falls  hours before the earthquake and it was incredible however i have no idea about the condition of the trails currentlyit was confirmed via a facebook post that the road leading to the trailhead had been damaged significantly enough to prevent traffic from entering so please be mindful that this area may no longer be accessible or open,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam

3.0,this could be a wonderful place to embrace the beauty of the nature that lombok offers unfortunately as in many other places on the island obviously many people dont hesitate to throw their trash disrespectfully in this forest this is a very sad fact and even worse considering this place a geopark where awareness and education should happen in order to conserve the fragile nature i also witnessed people crossing another limit and feeding wild monkeys what should have been forbidden by the present tour guide that was in charge of this group wild animals should not get too close to the visitors in order to respect their nature and to prevent possible attacksthe entrance fee should include as well a tour guide that has been educated on the importance of nature conservation and instruct the visitors accordingly and strictly,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam

5.0,a must visit waterfalls in lombok either before hike or after rinjanis hike  of the waterfalls are impressive and offers their own beauty and distinctivenessentrance fee is idr  per pax and they do expect some small amount of tips at the end of the tour if you engaged a local guide it is nice to have someone to help us cross and guide us which way to go in the waterfall so it is still worthwhile the tip as we left the waterfall in the late evening they even standby the torchlight to lighten our way out the waterfallbring swimsuit and expect to get wet when you go near to the waterfall do have a dip in the chill water that enough to get the chill run down your spine,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam

4.0,we have young toddlers but we went to lombok without the kids in retrospect the walk into the nd waterfall of tiu kelep is not recommended for young children or toddlersbut very beautiful waterfall especially the nd waterfall which is a walk further down in from the st waterfall you set your eyes on if in the senaru area this is a good place to visitwe went around pm that afternoon as we took a morning flight into lombok and could only do it in the last  hours before sunset that day from the number of people coming out on our way in we can only imagine it would get pretty crowded from the hours of am  pm peak period so if you wish to get a good photograph with nice background of the waterfall without people littering the background of your photo either go very early or much later towards evening timegood idea to go with sea shoes pls definitely do not go with slippers unless you wish to trek the journey back barefooted,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,it was a really unique waterfall an epic wall of vines hides multiple cascades that flow quietly down the wall ive never seen anything like it and felt like i was in a scene from a movie a few locals played in the manmade pools at the bottom of the falls and we helped them practice their english for a while before making the sprint back during a break in the rain,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam

5.0,you know i often read these reviews with interest and listen to words like rip off and gouging please spare me ok you drama queens we were a family travelling with a baby and i would thoroughly recommend you get a guide not only to help you with your stuff share their culture and history but also support the local economy they are charging peanuts we paid to get a motorbike down to the falls and then walked from there our guide helped us with the baby all the way technically the way is clear and chances of getting lost are minimal but the terrain is rough and very rocky having someone to help you over the rocks and through the river is so needed support the local economy people you leave more in tips and parking fares in uk europe and other first world countriesso to sum up waterfall is super beautiful make the effort and go to the second one which is really the show stopper take some watee or fruit with you and if you can get the motorbikes down it will save your knees and legs a bit,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,the place itself is beautiful but you dont need any guide they will try to force you and maybe show you some fake paper saying you must but you dont have to dont support this gouging and enjoy this easy  mins track count with the fact you must cross the river  times,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,it was challenging but well worth it lovely waterfalls splashes of water plus if you are lucky youll get rainbows at both areas,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,sendang gile waterfall is located in the village of senaru its spring comes from the foot of rinjani mountain the water is clear still very natural cool and cool very suitable for you who want to adventure tour what a great place to visit,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,totally worth the jungle trek the first waterfall you see is sendang gile which is stunning after a bit more trekking through the jungle you cut across the river  but be careful of your shoes as my husband managed to lose his sandal but not to worry coz the local kids rockhopped down the river to retrieve it for him for a tip of course you finally come to tiu kelep waterfall which left me speechless it was incredible the water was cold and so fresh and it was pristine despite all the people you must exercise caution though as the sheer volume of water falling causes a whirlpool effect which can suck you under and you shouldnt go under the waterfall as the pressure is immense,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,i had a chance to visit sendang gila and tiu kelepyou dont really need a guide but for a little tip i gave to the owner of my homestay he accompanied me to the waterfalls it was worth it cause he shared a lot of information on the fauna and flora of the region talked about traditions and culture we had a lot of fun he helped crossing that river that was the tricky part i like to help the local people as long as they are not too pushy there was litterally no one it was very nice walk in the forest sound of water you can have a back massage from the sendang gila waterfall and swim in tiu kelep just beware not to swim close to the fall of the water cause it is extremely powerful and u can get dragged in a swirl as long as you stay on the right hand side you can swim easily so to sum up it was worth it and another little tip if you want to have an amazing view of tiu kelep from up you can walk up towards the traditionnal village before entering turn left there is a path for about min walk up and look for the welcome to coffee plantation sign when you pass that sign there is a hidden viewpoint thats worth the trek,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,this is a most enjoyable walk through the forest with a spectacular endingyou must however get here early before the crowds arrive we met lots of people on the return and it deserves an early start to make is special,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,enterance fee is kperson for all tourists first stop is sendang gile which im not interested at all you can go to tiu kelep on right path before sendang gile follow the path and youll trekking on the river twice which was my favorite part make sure you wear swimsuit because its gonna be all wet remember that you can go by yourself a lot of local tour guide will offer you their services from the parking lot and inside it was kinda annoying they will follow you everywhere,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,both waterfalls are amazing and the second one is more they are in senaru village the way getting there is easy there are two main entrance which we may start from but the most popular is in parking area as the head the tickets are only k,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,i rode from senggi on a scooter with my friend on the back for two or so hours to get to this waterfall we stopped for lunch at a nice restaurant it began to rain and would not let up we were seriously considering to just leave and head back to the hotela couple at the restaurant said they saw the waterfall in the morning and it was also raining they said that we must gowe went small entrance fee first waterfall is nice nothing crazy afterwards we paid a kid  for him to guide us to the second waterfall realistically you can do this yourself but it was not much money and it was nice when crossing the river a couple of times to have someone who could help us to cross and show us the best waythe second waterfall is incredible i am soo glad that we took the time to drive all the way to this place from the first waterfall it was probably somewhere around  minutes to get to the secondthis is really a great place check it out,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,this two waterfalls is great tiu kelep is the best one with great viewyou just need to be there and feel the falls view superbbut to reach there u need abit effort to walk down the jungle and rivers which i really dont recommend for kids below  years and baby cause when raining its really hard and slippery all the walkways,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,we paid k from senggigi and that was over  hours because we went to the monkey forest on the way and that was a simple stop in the side of the road could have done without it we went on a monday best choice and we were in february so low season its k at the gate my tip you dont need a guide its a waste of money its a well worn oath with steps and railings so easy to find they want k for a guide who does nothing  we both wore things flip flops i broke a strap because i was wearing in the water  for best experience you need to wear something on your feet in the water i chose things its an easy walk to both falls first one just for looking you cant swim here the second further on you need to cross the stream pretty easy but slippery in placed we took a towel and change of cloths as we swam and there is such a huge back spray you get soaked anyway the way back it was  hr well worth the trip the insane driving keeps you awake in the car we had a nasi goreng at one of the few restaurants very cheap k,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,an amazing experience the waterfalls are beautiful and well worth the trip from gili trawanganill break this down into two parts first how i got there and how much and second what you see or experience at the waterfallsi paid ir  just under this includeda return boat from gili trawangan to lombok a driver in lombok for the day it is about mins from the harbour to the waterfallsentrance fee to sendang gile and tiu kelep waterfallsand a guidenow im not saying that this was cheapest option but how much are you trying to cut from i could have done it all on my own and it would have probably been cheaper but then i would have had more hassle and this would have taken up my timeso the waterfallsthere are pathways leading to the waterfalls so you can do it without the guide but it would still take a bit longer because its not like they are signposted also having a guide is good if you have any questions about the waterfalls or the area he will also help you in tricky parts if you need it there are two streams you need to walk through and some slippery rocks if youre under  you should be fine the guide will also take photos for you and look after your belongingsbe prepared for a lot of walking and steps i would recommend that you wear sea shoes your feet are going to be in water and you need grip hiking boots will take too long to dry and seeing people walking on rocks in flip flops is amusing to see there will be people selling rain jackets this is also amusing dont go to a waterfalls if youre not prepared to get wet also youll get so hot youll feel like youre in a greenhouse just bring a bottle of water there are stalls at the first waterfall if you forget you can also swim in the second waterfallto summarise the waterfalls were amazing worth every penny and the trip from gili trawangan just be prepared to work your calf muscles i tipped the driver  ir and the guide  ir not much just a gesture of goodwilljust to address the negatives people have postedrubbish  i have noticed plastic rubbish is a general problem in indonesia they need some topdown infrastructure to clean up what is a beautiful country however i didnt notice rubbish at the waterfallsscam  getting scammed is someone clearing your bank account paying for something like accommodation that doesnt exist or turning up and no one is there it is not paying a couple of pound for a guide to walk with you or ahead of you as they respect your privacy i never understand westerners im from london that dont want to support locals when they would spend more on a coffee in starbucks back at home,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,something in lombok that you should not miss visiting the waterfalls are so beautiful and majestic that you will automatically fall in love withthere are two trails and possible request for the trail the locals are maintaining it easy and flat trail then the other onepreferably have a guide to assistgood luck and enjoy the nature,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,its nice even on that rainy day a best place to combine with a rinjani trek  much better visiting during the morning less crowds that makes worth it,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,we went with our three year old on rented bikeshad a great time going to three waterfalls awesome experiance,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,pretty place to see in lombok the second waterfall is a must do the first one isnt that impressive at all the way to the waterfall is like walking in a jungle so its already fun itself the route is pretty easy couple river crossings would recommend to wear flip flops etc shoes with a rubber base it can be really slippery we drove here with a scooter from senggigi it was a long trip  hours maybe with couple of stops but worth it they tried to fool us by saying that its obligatory to take a local guide but we didnt just paid for the entrance fee and parking when we got down we didnt know which way to get to the second waterfall but there were these little kids who said theyll take us there if we pay k not sure which they ment but paid more since they were so great the boys were really cute and helpful they saved my flip flop when it got to the flow of the river without them it wouldve been gone if theyre there i really recommend to take these real life junglebook mouglis as your guide  but you can do it on your own too when you get down the stairs there goes a route to the right which will take you to the waterfall,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,we did the hike with my  and  year old children easy hike but a few river crossings waterfalls were beautiful definitely go to both not just the first one,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,the waterfalls were good with the second one being much better than the first  well worth the walk we swam in the waterfall although it was a bit coldbe careful about being ripped off our driver initially didnt drop us off at the waterfall entrance but at a tour company that wanted to charge us   rupiah for two people to see both waterfalls we had seen some reviews on here so that was way more than expected we left and asked to be dropped directly at the entrance where we met a local guide who charged us   rupiah this included the entrance feea guide is not completely necessary as you could probably manage ourselves but we appreciated having one as he took photos for us and helped us carry some of our thingswe wore flip flops and were fine although some nonslip water shoes might be useful if you are planning on swimming in the waterfall,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,i and my daughter visited this place in january  the way to sendang gile is quite easy because the road is made of cemented stone with stairs when we continue to the second waterfall tiu kelep i need helper to help me pass the river its slippery and the stone at the bottom of the river are unstable be careful not to fall into the river better wear plastic or rubber shoes that can walk in water once you arrive tiu kelep you can take a swim,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,the falls are only a short way from senaru and are easily reached by a mostly paved path you do have to pay a small admission fee you dont need a guide for the first set but generally do for the second set the route down passes some beautiful views and part of the amazing irrigation system that snakes its way around senaru the falls themselves are beautiful and not too busy when i visited  apart from a group of teenagers who seemed to be skipping school and delighted in dragging me under the falls to take selfies i got utterly drenched but i havent laughed that much in a long time if youre in the area and fancy a gentle mostly shaded walk then definitely do this,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
3.0,my friends and i went here hoping to see both of the waterfalls the walk to sendang gile was quite easy just stairs and a cement path there were lots of locals hanging out and bathing in the water lots of garbage and dirty diapers around but still a beautiful waterfall we were hoping to make it to tiu kelep also but it took us so long to find the path that the park would be closing before we even made it back definitely not worth it to drive all the way to senaru just for this but if you are already in the area seems like a good way to pass a few hours,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,me and my girlfriend didnt have time in lombok to do a rinjani trek  but we came up to senaru for one night before heading to kuta lombok just to see these waterfalls it was worth itmy main tip is to go early if you can we got to the entrance at about am i didnt want to use a guide and was mentally preparing myself for an awkward argument if they got as pushyrude as some reviews suggest but we were lucky in that there was no one at all by the gate asking to be our guidehowever there was a man in the entrance booth to pay the very cheap  idr per person entrance fee to this to me proves that a guide is not required  no matter what they try tell you otherwise why were we allowed to enter onewith this in mind my view for what its worth is that unless you want a guide which will have its advantages if youre interested in the wildlife and flora etc you should refuse some say you should do it just to give people a living but in my view tricking and pressuring tourists into paying for a guide by saying they are mandatory when they are clearly not should not be encouraged  as explained below the way there is mostly a marked path anywayonce we were in we skipped sendang gile first and walked straight to tiu kelep waterfall to get pictures before any crowds came  as we had read this was the more impressive of the two we decided to look at sendang gile on the way backthe walk was pretty easy another advantage of getting there early  not as hot i would suggest to do it in flip flops because there is a bit where you must wade through the the river to continue on the path which i found pretty fun better to have flip flops to just take on and off easily than proper shoes imo the rest of the way is just a normal path and stepstiu kelep was magnificent although id read good reviews beforehand it was still more impressive than i thought it would be in person the water falls from such a height you feel the spray from pretty far awaywe were at the waterfall itself for about  minutes and had it to ourselves the whole time we took photos and had a swim it was very cold but really refreshing bear in mind my visit was in january   which is wet season and also low season for tourism generally in balilombok it may not be as impressivequiet in the drypeak seasonwe went to sendang gile waterfall on the way back  nowhere near as impressive its still pretty high but this one seems more popular with locals as there are quite a lot of stalls here selling snacks etc  there is nothing like this at tiu kelep other than a small toilet block sadly this also means there is a lot more garbage around which has been a recurring theme for a lot of my travels through indonesiatiu kelep especially is well worth a visit if you are around this area but to avoid the dodgy guide problem and get the best out of it get there very early if you can,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,the waterfalls are stunning as is the hike through the jungle to get to them i recommend going early to miss the crowds,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
2.0,the first waterfall is simply not worth a visit its small and completely overrun with people that have no idea how to preserve nature it is full of litter everywhere with even local people seemingly not caring about all the rubbish scattered around their forest its incredibly disappointingthe second fall is far better and just about worth the short trek its larger and more impressive with fewer people and less rubbishthere is nothing difficult with the trek clear path and not challenging to walk we did it in flip flops you certainly dont need a guideoverall if youve got nothing to do then its worth a visit but might be disappointing,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,must visit and its really amazingthis was my third time in lombok and first visit to this waterfallyes i paid idr for the entrance and guide for me this was not a scam and its more like helping them earning something the guide did a good job helping me with my things carrying the drinks and snacks and bags with towel and clothes before the entrance please buy some drinks along the way the guide gave some explanation about the surrounding areasi skipped the first waterfall sendeng gila and went straight to the second one tiu kelep its really breath taking and amazing views not hard trekking at all make sure you take your photos here its can be a long wait because many people will take photos here,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,just amazing make sure to take the turn off and walk out to tiu kelep on the same trip you see air terjunswimming at tiu kelep ,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,i drove a motorbike for about  hours from senggigi the trek to the first waterfall took  minutes quite steep from there it takes  minuets to reach the other one i did not go with a guide i found the second one much bettermy tips wear footwear that can walk in water put away small items such as glasses beware of monkeys snatching your belongings and food walk along the river and stream from the second waterfall to enjoy tranquil atmosphere away from the crowd,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
3.0,went to the  waterfalls which are really beautiful and worth a visit if you have time and want to go to mount rinjani anyway be aware of guide and entrance fee scam i got totally ripped off by the guide who i paid  idr for the tour unfortunately i didnt read the reviews on trip advisor first so i hope you do,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,a few months ago when i visited the crazy spring waterfall and tiu keep i think this is a bet one in north lomboktake only hours from inn to tiu kelepvery beautiful very high recommend it if you come to lombok do not be afraidmake sure you are fit enough to travel,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,first things first  from what ive read it is not actually necessary to get a guide to go to the  waterfalls rp per person all in if you get a guide however from what i can see the guides are mostly local to the area and it is their sole source of income so fellow travelers why not part with a few dollars and help put something back into the communitywe are a couple of friends in our s who are admittedly not very fit we were met by our guide mowgli a small spritely guy near the entrance from there he told us it would be about  minutes to get to the first waterfall sendeng gile then a further  minutes to get to tiu kelep  minutes if we take it slowgetting to the st waterfall was easy you only had to walk down some steps there were a few local families having a picnic at the first waterfall spent a few minutes there taking pictures then off we went to the second one trek was not so easy this time it was uphill through some dense forest at times and we had to climb quite a few rocks along the way make sure to wear comfortable non slip shoes although our guide only wore rubber slippers advantage of having a guide here is he knows the trek like the back of his hands ensuring your safety and always lending a hand to keep you steady another advantage is that he will tell you the history of the place and show you all the interesting flora and fauna he spotted a rare silvered leaf monkey also known as black monkey or lutung way high up in the trees which we wouldnt have noticed on our own this endangered species is local to the area and not easy to spottrek left us quite breathless but the sight of tiu kelep was well worth the trek  it was majestic and its powerful icy mist cooled us right off after the hot hike we sat on the stones and took our time soaking in the icy water while admiring the beauty of the waterfallthe trek down was much easier and the guide used a different route through a dark water tunnel where you had to use a flashlight which was a novel experienceall in it was a pleasant day out and i would recommend this place to visitors,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,firstly may i say that anyone that complains about entry fee or paying a guide  come on its a few dollars in total and you are contributing toward not only the maintenance of the track etc but you are helping the local communityit is disappointing to see large amounts of rubbish near the falls themselves the walk itself is straight forward and anyone with basic level of fitness could do it suitable footwear required due to slippery and undulating terrain and some slippery creek crossings which for us were easy to crosssecond waterfall definitely the better of the  be very careful if swimming here as the waterfall generates a very powerful current in this pool as i discovered and i am a strong swimmerour local guide took us through tunnel on way back and whilst a bit novel it was something different be aware that there area a few holes along the way where concrete has eroded leaving exposed steel reinforcement mesh so be careful with your feetwe saw a few monkeys on way outoverall well worth it but litter and toilets near each waterfall detracts from the experience part with a few dollars people and get a guide put something back into the local community,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,being a retired couple we werent up for the arduous trek up mt rinjani so the walk to these  waterfalls ticked our boxes a challenging  hour walk up and down a rough path with the fantastic reward of stunning waterfalls you pay a token fee to enter the national park the first waterfall is only  minutes away down many flights of rough steps and you have the cheat option to grab a lift on the back of a local motorbike there were local families enjoying a splash in the chilly waters in the rocky pools at the base of the waterfall but we decided to push ourselves by walking another  mins to the next waterfall which was an enjoyable but more strenuous trek through dense forest there are small stalls set up along the path selling water drinks and snacks and enterprising young men who offer their services as guides with the option of taking you through tunnels used for water irrigation using headlamps we wanted to do our own thing but ended up paying rp about au to a young boy for the last  min stretch which took us over  shallow but fast running rivers it was worth the money to be shown the best stepping points through the water and slippy rocks we could hear the boom of the water crashing down into a pool at the base of the falls way before we could see it and as we got closer the air was filled with fine mist from the water it was spectacular many visitors chose to clamber over large rocks further towards the base of the waterfall to swim and feel the spray of the water but the pressure from the falls was very strong and you couldnt get too close suggest you wear comfortable shoes for clambering over rough terrain rocks and through water and it was very hot work so we were glad of the water we brought along to drink,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,the amazing waterfall that i found in senaru villageit is easy to visit it only runs less than an hourto get to the second waterfalltiu kelepthe sir is very fresh cause it is left surrounded by trees that are still green,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam

5.0,pending from where you have to start eg from senggigi it took us with taxi about  hours getting there you walk down to first waterfall  steps between rain forestonce down it is quite cool and windy from huge quatity of water which is falling down from heightsapprox  min walk to next waterfall  also quite impressiveand you can swim in basin belowon way back at late afternoon we even met wild monkeys,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,it takes about  hours to visit both falls it can be done on flip flops the first one is easy accesible for everyone you can stand underneath for a massage for the second one you have to walk through the water refreshing and not cold the best thing to do is to put out your shoes and put them back on when you are out the rocks are slippery especially the smooth and soft big rocks so keep away from them its a nice footmassage it can be dangerous when you go in the water at the second falls just keep in front on the right side a guide is nice but not absolutely necessary but the boys are cheap and make a living out of it,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,the trip was definitely worth it really liked the easy to medium hike to both waterfalls with fantastic pictures and beautiful naturebest part was swimming in the second waterfall stones are very slippery so better be carefulone thing that was a bit strange was the way how we got into the area the driver that we ordered did let us out before the official entry to the park and we were told that we would have to take a guide after bargaining we at least got a good price but still seems like drivers and guides know each other and share the money the get from confused tourists like us the guide was a very helpful and friendly teenager and walked us into the park from a side entry avoiding the entry fee we would to this tour again but next time insist that they let us out at the official entry and doing the trip ourselves without a guide,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,these falls are a good day trip whilst in lombok you will need to climb over some rocks to get to the second and go swimming flip flips are better than trainers as i found out the water is freezing but still worth it definitely worth the trip whilst on the island you can easily do this yourself without a guide its a well trodden path and you can follow the locals if youre not sure,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam

4.0,not necessarily to get a guide or we called pemandu over there it is very easy to have a soft trek there to reach these  waterfalls first of all pay k entrance fee and walk the stairs all the way down to reach the first waterfall and it takes about mins after that for the tiu kelep youll have to walk up again using the stairs therell be an intersection on your left for another stairs just continue walking and youll find the bridge cross it and found yellow dam and a small food stall there and just keep it up after that therell be  rivers to cross which are short distance only here you go an extra mins walk to get to the god of nature and it takes about mins depends on your pace,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam

5.0,we did this the day before the dn rinjani trek and loved it theres a bit of scrambling across rivers and treesroutes etc so would recommend water shoes but we managed it fine in flip flops we did it right at the end of the day with a guide which was great because there was no one else there at tui kelep but i can imagine it gets pretty busy the rest of the day based on the number of people we passed going in the opposite direction tui kelep is great for a refreshing swim and is only about  mins further down a fairly well marked path so would  recommend pushing past the busy first waterfall to get there,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,for those of you who love challenging tracks you can come on a trip to tiu kelep waterfall you will also cross a fairly shallow river in this river you will feel the coolness of the water flow is very clear,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam

5.0,really stunning waterfalls a short walk down to the first falls and a moderate walk to the second watch out for slippery ricks as you get close to the second fallsyou dont really need a guide but in my view unless you are a struggling backpacker and can afford to throw a measly  into the local community you probably shouldthe one downfall of this place is the amount of rubbish laying around mostly it seemed from the locals despite being several rubbish bins and anti litter signs rubbish was everywhere sadly often floating downstreamdo nature a favour and pick up one of the many plastic bags laying around and fill it up with trash on your walk back to the entrance minimal effort maximum reward,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam

4.0,ive been to a few indonesian waterfalls and these have been kept relatively clean no piles of rubbish near the bottom the walk is a little precarious especially to the second waterfall as it involves a few rapid river crossings and climbing over slippery rocks we paid  each for a local guide who carried our stuff helped us with the river crossings and watched our things while we swam under the waterfall but to be honest you probably dont need a guide the place is busy enough that you can just follow others to figure out how to get to the falls,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam

5.0,take a local guide we used one from the hotel because even though its well marked its helpful for knowing the nature and better routestake or wear water shoes as theres a good part of a stream to cross with a rocky bed many wore flip flops which dont give much securityand look for the lombok  about  the way back to tiu kelepa local women set up selling fresh fried banana fritters and veggie cakeswe bought on the way out and idr fed us and our guidewe were about  hours and total kmfor a soft trek i was pretty tired though you could hire a scooter to go in along the irrigation canalhighly recommended,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam

3.0,the first waterfall is  mins walk descending steps beautiful but not too good to be regretted later if not visited the second waterfall is  mins hike along a tunnel one has to cross some streams fun the second waterfall is beautiful but the water is too cold to have a shower the walk through the tunnel while descending is funthis is a nice break from the beach time in lombok and gilithe guide fee and entrance fee though is not worth the experience try to avoid getting a guide the waterfalls are easy to locate just pay the entrance fee once again a guide is just a waste of money,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam

5.0,we hiked to these falls on a tuesday and still encountered crowds of locals but only a few tourists however the falls are beautiful and the hike just challenging enough to add some excitement sendang gile is reached first by walking down  rocky uneven steps which only takes about  minutes the lush jungle is beautiful and the mist when caught in the sunlight reflected as a rainbow there were many folks here standing sitting and playing near the  meter high falls which are very impressive tiu kelep waterfall is above sendang gile with a gentle but rocky climb with many large tree roots the rocky trail is slippery but many were hiking in flip flopsthere are three river crossings for which a guide would be helpful unfortunately the trail is best hiked in sturdy soled shoes but the river crossings require sandals i brought both and just changed and it worked great the water flows fast but is not deep if you know where youre going the cool water felt great in the very hot and muggy conditions the  meter falls are beautiful and there were a multitude of folks enjoying the water and the scenery the crowds were a detraction but the falls were still stunning on our return several young boys on the opposite side of the river held out their hands to assist our crossing very cute we also saw young locals swinging on vines and calling out in their best tarzan imitation it was a fun time and wed do it again,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,a guide is a good idea if you are planning to walk to the falls as the river crossings can be quite tricky also if you go anywhere near the falls be prepared to get wet as the force of the water creates a very fine mistrainit is a good idea to wear sandals or shoes that have a good grip and can be immersed in water not flip flops as you can lose them easily when crossing swift water,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam

3.0,we paid rp per person for the tickets which is a good price the waterfalls are beautiful and definitely worth visit we were a little disappointed though because we read that it is quiet place instead there were hordes of locals taking pictures in the waterfalls taking showers and just sitting there on the rocks we didnt have a chance to take a picture without other people also by the first waterfall there are people selling snacks and it spoils the atmosphere,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,weve been there a few times taking different guests each time we took an ojek motorbike taxi to the furthest one sendang gile  then returned to the entrance to walk to the closer one tiu kelep  which was an easy walk downhill and then back up tiu kelep was pretty but very crowded with school groups when we went so there wasnt even anywhere to sit and relax in contrast tiu kelep was less crowded and after a swim we found somewhere quiet to sit and relax and have a picnic and enjoy the scenery very beautiful location and highly recommended for a halfday trip from mataram or senggigi but no you need to waste money on for a guide,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,we paid  ruppiah per person be careful with the guides in front the sign with the entrance fees is not immediately visible when standing in front of the entrance and after telling him we did not want a guide he first made us an offer for  fortunately my husband saw the sign with the official priceswe did not take a guide as we just wanted some peace and solitude for once and not the constant small talk that comes with local guidesif youre not sure where to go just follow the groups it was well worth the time and we spent a couple of hours at the two waterfalls,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
2.0,to get to this waterfall you must either walk a downhill trek over a rough rocky  metre path or take the offer of a mopedmotorcycle pillion ride offered by the local youths at a fee i took the motorcycle option without realising the risks involved on the precarious hillside journey it was narrow rough and slippery in places and the moped i was on was not in full control in places my weight was such that every bump we went over resulted in me pushing forward the driver until his navel was pressing on the handlebars he was losing control while riding downhill to the waterfall we were frequently met on the blind bends by returning motorcycles and our handlebars clipped each other a recipe for disaster in the makingthis is an attraction the benefits of which are really not worth the risks involved i am sure it would not be covered by any sensible travel insurance,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,my trip was arranged and guided by rinjani lighthouse our journey started at am from our resort not getting there too early because the water is even colder too early in the morningthe waterfall scene is nice swimming in the water is cold but yeah was really greatgo go go,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam

4.0,this is a waterfall where its not just about the scene but where you have to take a nice dip in the water it is voluminous enough that you just can not not get in unless you have a total fear of water come prepared with wet clothes and waterproof camera at least have em protected in a plastic bag etc  not sure which is which but the waterfall which took the longer walk is much better than the first so go there its worth the walk,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
3.0,the first waterfall was easy to get to and was nice but there was loads of rubbish everywhere and there were locals burning plasticrubbish you cant swim at this one the second one was much harder to get to most people take a guide but we didnt and we got there fine youve got to cross the river so be prepared to get wet this waterfall was awesome and was nice for a quick dip it was pretty cold,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam

5.0,beautiful gorgeous waterfalls i recommend to visit during the morning less crowds that makes the cold yes cold worth it,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,i had a private driver and a guide was organised by the tour co access to the first falls is by steps and takes about  mins to get there the falls view was pleasant and taking photos was fine provided you take from the right hand side as the air current will spray moistureaccess to the second falls required a bit more effort and as previous reviews have stated to wear flip flops or plastic based sandals once your flipflops are wet you stand the risk of slipping out of themthere are basic ablution facilities a few meters short of the falls and were fairly clean the view of the falls is excellent and you can swim in the water if you dont mind the cool temperature taking photos close by is not going to happen as the spray is fairly intense you can get reasonable shots about  meters away if you choose the best spot but be aware the rocks are extremely slipperywater from the falls is directed into channels for irrigation,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam

4.0,it took us about  to visit both waterfalls the guide was fun and you will cross rocky rivers and step on slippery stones our guide advised us to wear sandals or flip flops because we would be getting our feet wet up until the quads so empty your pockets but this made it very dangerous dont listen to him and just wear hikingold shoes that can get wet at the big waterfall you can swim for a bit on the way there is a monkey forest and the monkeys are not shy at all and just come eat right out of your hand it is worth the visit if you stay nearby not so much if its hours away,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,we booked a private tour here which included the monkey forest k for our private driver when we parked up he sorted a guide nice young lad for k but we gave him k as previous reviews have said you dont really need a guide but sometimes it helps to give the local people something back the waterfalls are nice but just too busy especially when we went on a sunday with locals the trek was okay but it was an easy path all the way  like a conveyer belt waiting for people to cross the river worth a visit but the jungle hike to munduk waterfalls in bali is a better walk,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam

5.0,i would go to the falls early in the morning to avoid the big crowd eventhough senaru is a sleepy tourist town and doesnt get too many visitors compared to the more popular beach towns and the gilis but the falls very well visited by locals and its one of the few attractions in senaru so everyone goes to itthe falls are very beautiful but again the place is small and hard to enjoy with too many people,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,we met sendang gile with a bit of a shrug of the shoulders to be honest but dont lose faith  they saved the wow factor for tiu kelepafter an easy  min stroll to sg you definitely get more of a challenge on the way to tiu kelep you get more of a walk and then have to cross a fast moving stream a couple of times which i hear can cause some very astute travellers to almost lose their flipflops despite their obvious vigilance and awesomeness duck under a low hanging branch and navigate many slippery rocks honestly its not for people with mobility issues and some wet shoes or sandals would be the best choicetiu kelep is a stunner anyway its a beautiful half ring of falls with a spout over the top all going down into a central pool well worth the trek there oh yeah and now back,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,we booked transport and a guide through our hotel in senggigi which cost idr  yes you can do it cheaper with a blue bird taxi without a guide but for comfort and safety we felt this was the best optionthe journey from senggigi was about  hours and our driver stopped at photo opportunities a few spots along the way with views of the gili islands and the rice fields we arrived and were met by our guide who said we should wear flip flops as well have to cross a river to get to tiu kelep flip flops were ok but not easy for this luckily i had some wet shoes with grip but my partner went barefoot in the end as it was very slipperysendang gile is a short walk down some stairs and is beautiful to see with waterfalls running through the trees at this point i was dubious about the neccessity of a guide as the path was clear and easytiu kelep is more impressive and more difficult to get to more trekking than stairs to this one this is where the guide was extremely helpful as he led us across the safest route in the river and kept our belonging safe whilst we went for a swim in the rock pool the water is freezing but very refreshing after the jungle trek very exhilarating experiencewell worth the trip and the cost is fair for the help and service we had we also tipped our guide for carrying our bags across the river and our wet shoes as we climbed the stairs to the exittheres a restaurant at the top where our driver waited whilst we ordered lunch with a great view of mount rinjani and the valley below,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,if you go here expect a little trek for the second waterfall and full on trek for the third onewe only did the two but it was well worth itfirst waterfall is easy and it rather lovely you can sit and have your lunch there the second one is a little bit more of an effort as you have to go over a fast flowing river a few times and it can be very slippy but once you get there it absolutely stunning if not a bit busy but you can see why people go you can swim and jump in really enjoyed itthey try all sorts to get you a guide and try to rip you with all sorts of unofficial things only buy for  at the gate with an official as best it can be personwe got taken to shops and various people but we read the reviews and said no are you official no you are not so we did not do that all all just please be careful you dont really need a guide we never you just tag onto everyone elsethats aside its well worth id and not to be missed,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam

5.0,so my girlfriend and i came to indonesia on a girls trip and stopped in lombok to see some waterfalls we stayed in senggigi and easily rented a scooter for the day from our airbnb host it was about a  hour ride to the sindang gile falls but it was very simple you dont need to hire a car or tour guide to take you there we followed one road the entire way there only turning right once when the road directed us towards bryan a small village close to the falls we stopped for gas once and spent r once we arrived men directed us where to park and showed us a map of the falls location they told us it was the law that you have a guide to the second falls but we had heard thats not the case at all we told him we werent interested and that we were only going to the first set of falls anyways at the entrance gate you should pay no more than r per person so we paid  for the two of us and made our way in there are steep stairs down to the first waterfall so be careful not to slip as you are about to reach the first falls notice a bumpy stone trail off to the right that leads you to the second waterfall we stopped for photos at the first set of falls and headed on our way no one stopped us and there were a few other groups coming back that didnt have a guide the only thing i was glad about was that there was a group of guys ahead of us with a guide so we were able to watch the easiest place where they crossed the river and just follow them otherwise theres no need for a guide at all just follow the trail it was pouring rain by the time we reached the second falls but it was amazing definitely worth it when we came back the river was rushing a little quicker due to the downpour but we made it across fine and gave one of the guys r when we got back to the parking lot for watching our scooter we did the entire trip for r and ive read of people who spent over a million dont believe the scammers it can easily be done yourself great trip,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam

4.0,you dont need a guide to sendang gile but definitely need one to tiu kelep the route to tiu kelep is a bit tricky and its best if you have local to guide you to the place and dont forget to slide through the water before the tunnel on your way back good experience but beware of getting your pants ripped,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,easy to reachwhile our driver already call his friend at location to accompany uswith his capacity we are satisfied our visit,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,little bit difficult to find and the road is not that good  we were travelling on a motorbike but we found it  and stopped at a coffee shop on the hill there was a guy who was a guide and we paid him   to take us to the waterfalls he was a really nice guy and pointed out all the fruit trees along the way and he knew a lot of the area as well,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam

4.0,i went there with my brother and sister actually my parents was there but i think its not suitable for elderly from the parking area we have to walk along in a certain distance which have saveral stairs and walk up and down to get the waterfall area thats why its not suit for elderly peopleits quite adventurous for young people me and my sibling enjoy it and it worth because when you meet the waterfall all your effort is rewarded,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,if you intend to visit tiu kelep waterfall pls engage a guide who will approach you at the entrance the going rate is idr  excluding tips which you are highly encouraged to give at the end of the trip if the guide has done a good job,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,if you are in senaru dont miss this waterfallits so refreshing to take a walk to tiu kelep fresh air a bit river water trekkingits about  mins walk to tiu kelepdont forget to slide on the natural waterslide at the drainage and hire the local child as your guide to play with they still build some changes room and or toilet near the waterfall,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,we when go to waterfallwe used sapar for our guideabout  minutes to first one from starting poinand still about one hour to the second onetiu kelep is nicer than sendang gilewe can swimbut the way its was not easy if you without the guide so i recommended take a guide for your safety,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,actually the walk to the waterfalls were not v tough but because of the sudden heavy rain things got v trickythe currents were v strong so made the river crossing quite a challenge every step became a mini waterfall and paths were rather slippery especially the pebbled ones an alternative route when going back was via the big underground drainage we tried this route and the water level came up to our knees which made walking not that easy esp in the darkhaving a torch at hand would certainly help,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,went as a family with a  yo and  yo it was an amazing adventure for all of us first time they had seen a waterfall so imagine seeing something as spectacular as tiu kelep and sendeng gile our guide was very good in making sure we were safe and went at a reasonable pace we arrived there early before the crowd came in and was very peaceful the waterfalls are stunning breathtaking to say the leastthe trek was doable for the kids i wouldnt consider it difficult for adults there are river crossings but our guide made sure we knew where to step and how to move alongnote the water is very very cold highly recommended a must go for nature lovers,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
3.0,the first waterfall is kind of a double waterfall because one floats into anotherthe waterfall itself is really nice however it is the same as everywhere on lombok plastic waste everywhere locals that try to rip you off of course you have to pay for everything entrance fee and parking if you enter the waterfall at the wrong place then people tell you that you are only allowed to go to the second waterfall with a tour guide they show a piece of paper with where the law is written on of course its total nonsense you can go there on your own and no one will stop youpersonally i think its a waste of time to go there because you will need at least hmin to get there,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,the first one from the entrance will take you roughly about  minutes to reach mostly descending towards the waterfall and some up but mostly paved all the way bigger ground area at sendang gile so you can sit around and relax as well as get some drinks as there are some vendors found here tiu kelep from here is about  minutes to get to depending again on fitness level but mostly a little ascending and descending with a portion crossing ankle deep fast flowing stream finally arrived at the waterfall and you will notice the water spray depending on the wind direction and velocity of the falls quite difficult to take photos as it will be packed with people i am pretty sure when you get there so be patient and you may get a chance to get a nice pic a much nicer waterfall and a must to get into the water here sadly i see garbage and litter left by visitors which is not something i would hope to see trekking back to senaru you can either head through a dark tunnel which more or less works like a shortcut in knee deep gushing water or take back the same route,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,wonderful afternoon visit to amazing waterfalls  you can swim at one of them the surrounding area is also beautiful and locals are friendly we did an afternoon trip from gili trawangan and then went on to stay the night at senggigi,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
3.0,this place was beautiful but we felt we were scammed a bit by our driver and whatever dodgy set up he has going on we paid k for him for the day which we were happy to do we asked to go somewhere for lunch and he took us to some run down tour office with a few mouldy chairs outside we were told it would be a hours walk and would cost k for a guide the same as our driver for the entire day we asked if we could do it without a guide and were told we would get lost we managed to negotiate k for the two of us but felt afterward that a guide was unnecessary the paths are really clear and there are lots of people doing the same track so its pretty hard to get lost the waterfall itself was stunning dont get a guide,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,my group of friends and i went to lombok to climb rinjani but we were turned back down at pos  so our trekking guide decided to bring us to see the waterfalls to try to lift our spirits upit was beautiful the trip there needs you to climb stairs and cross rivers but when you get to the waterfall it is all worth it definitely lifted our moods upon the way back our guide let us walk through the drains as a short cut instead of walking along the trail that was an odd experience but super funhighly recommended to visit,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,more like a virgin waterfall this place is pretty untouched with very few visitors as its tucked in away  minutes into the jungle u need to climb plenty of stairs and hurdle through streams of flowing water but when u reach it its worth every second,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
2.0,well to be honest im quite upset with the tourist information system in this placewhen i arrived my driver brought me to the first tourist information center and the guy there explain the contour and how many waterfall can we achieve how long we will walk and etc and then he offered us a package for  person which cost rp  yes you read it right almost a million rupiah just to see  waterfalls and because i was in a very bad mood i yelled and said no way lets get out of here its a scam right in front of the guyi just came back from rinjani and for that price i can get my own porter for maybe  days in rinjani no way ill pay for a guide that much only to go to the waterfallsi asked my driver to drive us back to senggigi even though its  hours ride from there lol and the other driver who heard me told my driver to take us to another tourist information centeri wanted to decline but my friends really want to see this waterfalls so we ended up going to another tourist center where i asked them directly how much theyll charge usand they answer with a list of price which in the end cost us more rp personand i answered with a firm no we explained to them we just got back from rinjani and will not accept the price they scared us with a story about a manwoman got possessed in the middle of track or something like that and i kept saying nomy friend bargain the price and ask for rp  for  persons take it or leave it and they take it i assume you can bargain more if you have time or just go straight to the waterfall like the local and pay rp fortunately our guide quite good he explained the name origin the path help us with slippery path and also take care of our possessions when we played in the waterfalls he even provide the flashlight to enter the tunnel oh you should definitely try the tunnel when you get back from tiu kelep its fantastic experience and kinda spooky if you afraidfor the waterfall itself i like the tiu kelep more and if you want to swim or relaxing choose the tiu kelep and pass the sendang giletips bring a sandal and wear shorts because youve to cross the river to go to tiu kelep,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,tiu kelep is stunning and the short hike there is also beautiful go straight to tiu kelep first skip sendang gile and go early to beat the crowds from town you dont need a guide when you hit the river and there doesnt seem to be a path just wade up through the river and youll see it on the left,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,the best thing about sendang gila and tiu kelep waterfalls are that they have not constructed manmade structures around these which usually makes convenient for many visitors but then destroys the natural scenic beauty and the surrounding of an attraction such as waterfalls it is not required in this case the experience is exhausting as there are several stairs to walk up and down small streams to crossover and slippery rocks to climb and pass however when you see the beauty of these falls in pristine state and cool fresh water flowing as transparent as wind it just makes you forget the hardship of reaching this place plan properly take guide as preferable unless you are a prohiker i recommend agus a lean and young local with adventurous spirit while returning from the second waterfall he took us through water tunnel which was amazing and one of the best experiences we had he also took our bag to carry which was very helpful while crossing small streams too he took i and my wife one by one across which was very careful approach for nonregular visitors of such terrain a guide is always handy i could provide the number of agus the guide if you need else when you reach the parking lot before entering the waterfall area ask for agusthe trekking time for nontrekkers such as us took more than  hours as we were slow both the waterfalls have basic toilet but better use the one at parking lot each toilet has a usage charge of k rp at first waterfall they sell fried items such as pisang goreng but better you keep your own food in case your journey happens to be during midday and if you tend to get hungry during those hours and do try water tunnel,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,need to be physically fit between  step to climb before reaching the waterfall beautiful and virgin waterfall but public amenities was missing,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,we booked through our hotel a day trip yes you could call it a day trip cause it takes about h to get there from senggigi for around idr  the way there is very nice the scenery is beautiful and with barely any traffic in the hotel they told us we should not pay more than  pax for the guide but recommended to take one as the second waterfall was hard to find without it once there the tourist information wanted to charge us  each but bargained for  in the end with no cookies and other goodies they were including although i think we could have got it for  use your bargain skillsthe first waterfall is nice easy path with people but not too bad you can go behind the big one which is the cool part the second waterfall was great extremely beautiful place cold refreshing water with a natural pool indeed harder to find not much of a path but with the amount of people you can just follow the crowd you have to cross river so would recommend for you to wear appropriate shoes the way is pretty and saw a few monkeys the way back you should take the tunnel its about  but pretty cool and differentworth time energy and money with rinjani closed for hiking good way to go into nature and escape senggigi,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,i went here with my husband and it took about  hours drive from the city i read the review regarding the entrance fee which includes the guide so the hint that i got from my driver its better that the driver pay the fee and inform them that it was a package that way the fee will not be that expensive i got rp  for each person in my opinion it is better to use a guide as he knows the track very well and he was very helpful our guide also good in taking a pictureso the attraction has two main waterfalls the first one can be reached about  minutes walk the path was easy and safe with many steps the second waterfall took about  minutes from the first one the path was more heavy but still easy it was a little bit slippery so just be careful the path will includes walking through small river with rocks the second waterfall was bigger than the first one the water was very cold and clear take a bath and feel refreshed going back our guide offer us to took the tunnel the tunnel was very dark but it has a hole every  m which can be a source of light from outside i felt adventurous going back through the tunnelbetter to visit this place in the morning as it can be crowded at noon and afternoon,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,it is a nice walk inside the forest to reach  of the waterfalls with first one sendang not having option to swim in it second one tiu kelep though gives you a chance to breeze and have be careful of strength of the water splashing a dip into fresh cold wateryou dont need but can take a tour guide with you to see both sendang gile and tiu kelepin the way back you will see plenty of monkey aroundtrip time  approx hourscost   aud per head with the guide,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
3.0,we visited the waterfalls this december  the waterfalls are ok  although i felt it has been overrated there are much better waterfalls the saddest part is those touts  that cheats the tourist our driver rented car cooked up a story about him able to get a good rate for guide initially the socalled government information center asked for  rupiah to guide  persons the driver than intervene and the price dropped to  rupiah we gave and agree to pay since we have driven  hours to reach that spot from singigi personally  its not worth the hassle and being cheated by those touts,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,it was a great experience well worth it after the drive  approx  hours from senggigiwe organised a private car by asking our taxi driver from the night before the car cost idr  for the whole day and the driver waited whilst we walked to the waterfalls and backwhen you arrive at the tourist office you are greeted by the organiser who will walk you through the fees standard prices printed on a sheet for a group of  seeing the  out of  waterfalls the price was idr  each which included the guide and some snacks fruit water and biscuits the round trip to the waterfalls including the swim was roughly  hours with the first waterfall being only  mins away but not suitable for swimming and not very largewe didnt have enough time to go to the rd waterfall as we were told it would take another  or so hours but we were told the nd waterfall is possibly the best onein terms of attire we wore shoes expecting serious hiking but it wasnt too complex when choosing shoes either wear some shoes you can cross streams with or just wear flip flops very doable in flip flops there was no insects so shirts and shorts were fine and we took a light rain coat as it rained half way through a towel is a must if you intend to swim definitely worth a swim under the big waterfall and a backpack is recommended to free your hands for the trekthe guides were very friendly and helpful they carried your snacks and umbrella and helped you along the way in addition to providing all the useful factsthe nature walk wasnt the best i have seen however the whole experience was worth it the drive takes you through many villages and the swim at the end helps you escape the humid weather a definite must when visiting lombok,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
5.0,we booked this from gili air with our resort now im quite picky about which bodies of water i want to enter into my very early memories of kota tinggi are not very fond ones  crowded and you dont know what people have left in those waters the same goes for the hot springs and crystal pool tour in krabi  an intriguing sightexperience and a refreshing walk through the nature reserve but i dont think id like to share those waters with everyonewith the waterfalls sendang gile and tiu kelep this was different its got to be practically impossible to foul the chill crystal waters that plummet from several stories above you also it is a real experience to approach the crashing waters spray billows out forcefully blinding you and sending water droplets flying at impossible trajectories braving the cold one inches forward to stand under the waterfall for a massage but it is really something to feel how water can fall so fast and hard that it hurts like the blow of a baseball batthe waterfalls are both amazing sights and the trek you take to reach them both is fairly simple and interesting bring wet shoes or sandals for you will be splashing through the streams on your way there one more thing to note make sure you get the earliest trip possible to enjoy the waterfalls with relatively lesser people ours began at am at gili air this is important  the later you begin the more crowded the place will be,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,there are two waterfalls in this activity the first is a clear waterfall were water comes out of the side of the mountain it is about a min walk from the bus drop off you can walk under the waterfall but there is no swimming the next waterfall is about a  min walk with good tracks some ups and downs but very achievable the local guide explains the falls and the way some water is taken for irrigation for the rise fields we visited during heavy rain so the river crossing were difficult due the the fast running currents wear good trekking footwear as feet get wet and rocks sharp and slippery the second waterfall comes from the river approve as well as from the side of the mountain both brown and clear water flows normally you can swim under these falls but the currents were to strong during our visit lunch available at the bus drop off area at the end of the walk ok to tip the guide,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam
4.0,the waterfall is nice and worth visiting as far as i know a local guide is required by the time we visited the falls it was a little overcrowded may  combine this trip with visiting real traditional villages there are multiple in the neighborhood,Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep Waterfall,NTB,Alam

3.0,be prepared to say no many times to many people as you make your way through the village unless you wish to purchase multiples of the same items as most houses in the village sell the same itemsthe tour was interesting though and do ask to be shown the insides of a house  the kitchen area the sleeping area for the parents and sons their village wells toilets etconly go if you have nothing else to do,Sade Traditional Weaving Village,NTB,Budaya

3.0,this is a tourist spot its a traditional village of the original lombok inhabitants and one can see their housing and their lifestyles as well as get to talk with a local guide and find out about their lives for that reason its interesting but its also a commercial enterprise as it has to be i guess the village is on the side of a hill so a small bit of climbing involved its hard to think how the villagers actually manage to live on the site with tourists lurking around every corner you are asked for a donation on entering and then there is the guide fee,Sade Traditional Weaving Village,NTB,Budaya
3.0,we took a long drive to get to the traditional weaving village after being in the car for  hours with a driver that spoke no english we were just excited to get out and stretch our legs upon arriving a man who spoke very good english greeted us and strapped me in to one of the weaving looms this was very cool as they allowed me to work on their traditional patterns it was pretty cool the man then tried to sell us many goods which we did end up buying we were there for about  minutes total it was cool to see them weaving and making the goods but it was a long hike and maybe no worth the drive if you are near there its worth stopping by,Sade Traditional Weaving Village,NTB,Budaya

3.0,it is a little bit outside of mataram and therefore not very easy accessible you can take a bemo there but you have to change several times depending where you are travelling from getting back to the city centre is a bit more difficult then getting there we didnt find any bemos that were travelling back to mataram but luckily a nice indonesian family took us along the temple itself is very beautiful we have only visited one other hindu temple pura meru in mataram so we do not have much of a comparison in front of the temple there are a lot of guides who can tell you something about the temple itself but we didnt hire one if you want you can buy an egg for  rp and then feed the holy eels with a holy man be aware though that the eels dont always come to eat entrance on donationwe visited on a sunday and there were a lot of people praying and practising rituals the shrines were very beautiful in our opinionworth a visit if you are in the neighbourhood,Lingsar Temple,NTB,Budaya

3.0,but od not plan a trip for it because it is not worth it in mataram is not so much to watch at all but trafic and people th lingsar temple does not change so much about it better copies are found at bali but if you did not see anything lik this it could be a nice taxi drive to it the admission is not free  rp but the money appears to be used for maintenance and so its worth it its a nice serenity in a busy town if the closely built mosk keeps silent too but thats not sure at all,Lingsar Temple,NTB,Budaya
3.0,this is another temple keen to show a unity and cooperation with a muslim dominated lombok our guide told us of how th century muslim lombok was overrun by the hindu king of bali there is a facility in the temple complex where muslims cana leo pray however this is not a formal set for regular prayers or friday prayersagain a lot of the building has been replaced with new brickwork as the existing building has not survived much over the last  yearsagain this is not worth a passing visit unless you are really into hindu temples or simply want to tick something off a bucket list,Lingsar Temple,NTB,Budaya

1.0,nothing special its small there is nothing to see just many sellers trying to earn some money do not bother and safe time for some nice temples,Lingsar Temple,NTB,Budaya
1.0,i was there on  august with my fiancee and had the same experience as frankieyongthe taxi guide who took us there said there was no need for a guide but immediately after we alighted a man in black quickly walked towards us and claimed to be a guide for the templewe had no choice but to have him tag along as he insisted it was mandatorythe temple was in ruins and was mildly interesting the guide did not offer much information and the tour was over in less than  minutes we were asked to donate  rp to the priest of the temple this was taken by the guide who left to pass it to the priest i suspect the guide pocketed the money he said the priest gave us  rp in return to donate to the box before we left the templeon our way back to the taxi the guide also asked for  rp from each of us for his services so thats  rp or  sgd for  minutes work this is equivalent to the entry level salary of a bachelor degree holder in singapore easiest  rp for any local compare this to the porter who helped carry over kg of supplies up and down our hike to senaru crater rim  they only got twice that amount for  times more workit is totally unethical and immoral for him to profit on this religious site and i hope the local authorities take action i would recommend tourists to stay away from this temple and not allow this unauthorised profiteering to continuethe guide also charged our taxi  rp for parking parking at epicentrum lombok costs only  rp per entrydo whats right and boycott this atrocity and may the  religions reward the guide accordingly,Lingsar Temple,NTB,Budaya
4.0,we went there by our taxi guide immediately came a guide and we told him that we do not required a guide since we do not have much time and just intend to have a quick look and snap few pictureshe insisted that we take him as he is the owner of the place we do not believe him otherwise he would better just collect the entrance fee like any other temple attractions we asked how much he would charge us and reply that up to us to give well we took him as our guide then he explained to us every structure and history about the temple and after  minutes with him we decided to end the visit and gave him a some token of appreciation  rp he said not enough and we asked how much he wants he quoted rpwe are reluctant to give that much and walked to our park taxi and he followed almost like going to have a fightwhen all of us in the taxi he blocked the car and spoke to our driver in their language our driver told us if we can give more which we still refused we asked our driver to drive and thats consider a safe for us but felt angryto those tourists i think you should insist for not taking a guide if you do not wish to however you should not miss pura lingsar as it is among the best temple in lombok,Lingsar Temple,NTB,Budaya
4.0,taking a cab to this temple from narmada temple and it was quite a short trip not taking really much time as soon as we arrived there a local guide directly approached us and we had no choice but to let him guide us it is actually okay because he told us a lot about stuff in this temple and also local history which fascinated me because i am a history buff he brought us to a wishing pool we wished for something and then threw a coin backwards it is said that the wish will come true if the coin directly went to the pool mine bounced a bit several times but once again it is a believeitornot so yeah do not expect too much overall this place is recommended for the religious and historical value but i just dont like it when we were forced to buy something at the end of the tour,Lingsar Temple,NTB,Budaya
4.0,well kept you will find some tourist as well as local outside looks quite rough and dirty but once you are in is better than the most commercial ones around it is a small object though and will take you max hr to walk around and listen to the guide,Lingsar Temple,NTB,Budaya
3.0,small compared to temples at bali private guides will approach to lead you around since i was with a toddler my attention was on her hence i was not keen to have a guide aroundhe said it is part of management and i have to engage him when queried on the management of which i did not see any signs or notices saying its a requirement he roped in another person saying he was the one incharge of managementi mumbled some stuff and walked away,Lingsar Temple,NTB,Budaya
3.0,pura lingsar is probably the only worthgoingtemple in lombokbut again you have to donate for admission which doesnt sound right for me i dont mind if i need to be charged for admission but could you please dont use the word donationi really like the concept of the harmonytemple i believe theyre not calling it temple sorry i forgot the word there are two parts of pura lingsar one is hindu temple another one is all other than hindu temple for example muslim buddhism christianity and many morebut i encountered one big bad experience when me and my girlfriend came down from the cartheres one guy approached us and very friendly wanted to introduce this and thatbut in the end when were leavingholy fxck he asked us for donation and he said usually people gave him k zzi really appreciate his friendly introduction of pura lingsar but its totally unnecessaryhaizpersonal advice be caution there are always bad people in good places that want to take advantage on you,Lingsar Temple,NTB,Budaya

4.0,this temple is a testament to religious tolerance it gives you an insight into religious traditions on lombok easily accessed and easy to walk through as there are no huge steps to climb its a shame it is an exception to the rule in indonesia a few more scattered throughout java would be a thought to ponder we have been meaning to visit here for many years so  long time local friends organised the trip and it made things easy for us the tour guide was informative and multilingual there is no entry fee but payment is expected for guides in indonesia as it could be their only source of income,Lingsar Temple,NTB,Budaya
2.0,when we arrived hadnt even got out of the taxi when a guide approached and said you have to go with a guide which out taxi driver said no entrance fee guide seemed pleasant and knowledgeable once we started the tour it became blatantly obvious this was a moneymaking process the prices we were told to pay for the different parts of the tour were ridiculous left a bitter taste in your mouth whilst we enjoyed the history aspect of the tour and information we received i would not recommend to go unless you get some prices before you enter once we had paid for the guide the sarongs the eggs for the eels and the man to call the eels the donation for all  religions it cost us over  rupiah and we didnt pay what was asked for whilst this is not a lot compared to other temples we have been to in indonesia it is exorbitant maybe we had a dodgy guide,Lingsar Temple,NTB,Budaya

5.0,i was travelling to lombok by myself to study and it was my first time being in indonesia alone i was booked in for  nights but ended up extending it to firstly the rooms super clean worlds biggest bed lovely bathroom open space deliciously cool aircon and complimentary water that is replaced every day usually hotels only give you one round of complimentary water also all the soapstit bits in the bathroom the teacoffee station is also replaced every daylocation it is very central in terms of it is located in the city region of lombok its  minutes from mataram mall and very close to many restaurants commercial shops and amenities like telkomsel grapari grocery stores hair salons laundry services banks however if you are after a rolloutofbedandintotheocean kind of place expect a minute cab first to senggigifacilities it is quite new so when i got there the gym wasis still being put together but is coming along very well with a nice variety of equipment and floor space too it also has aircon and a shower the pool is lovely there is no lifeguard so theres no real deep end m but plenty of deckchairs very clean and of course theres also a bar there is also a spa which offers a variety of massages facials reflexology stone treatments and all sorts again at a very reasonable price hr massage  audfood they were just putting in a new menu when i was leaving but quite diverse and obviously reasonably priced  most expensive thing being like aud most items less than aud but the star as it always is was the breakfast buffet aud pp they have a pastry section fruits section cereals juices egg station wafflepancake station and of course hot food for european travellers the hot food is primarily of asian cuisine  ie fried ricenoodles veggies and meat dishes  i didnt see any bacon but there were sausages if you are into asian food please be wowed they have a bubur station rice porridge station where you can customise your bubur with all these toppings and condiments and just truly a dreamfinally service this is where you need to take a seat and listen the staff here are so friendly and the manager niyar goes beyond the call of duty truly i was travelling alone so i was already a bit scared but i was also there over nye alone seriously i knew no one i was so indecisive but i last minute decided to go to gili t by this time though i had missed the public boat and taxis were going to be  so reception organised a personal driver for me for a set price who also picked me up the next day from the port unfortunately i ended up getting incredibly sick that night and my driver was super understanding and promptly picked me up and took me back to aston i stayed in my hotel room for two straight days absolutely exhausted because my stomach was super sensitive i couldnt order anything from the room service spices herbs etc so when i asked reception where my nearest option for bubur ayam rice porridge with chicken highly recommend in times of runny bums the manager drove out to get it for me delivered it to my room and then would not let me pay for it can you read can you see that level of service instead of only suggesting hotel menu food he went out of his way to get me food that would benefit my health and would not accept my money also every single staff member smiles and says hi to you and is just so so courteous the front desk literally became my pals and shofi bless this gal gave me a friendship bracelet also the staff are all locals and can give you plentyyy of advice as well as organising tours for you on all the sights to see things to do and travel tipsrecommendationsso i cannot say a single bad thing about my stay i honestly felt so at home and all the staff made me feel so welcome and truly cared for  not just some guest or room numberif you are in mataram by yourself or with family too of course treat yourself to a stay at the aston inn honestly you wont regret it,Aston Inn Mataram,NTB,Urban

3.0,the hotel has is on the beach front with a great view it has a modern design but a lack of local charm like you could found in most hotel of balilombokit is very calm and quickly boring no surf no bars not one living soul on the beach only the hotel it is well maintained except  mice running between my feet on the pool deck the rooms are clean and standard no problemfor usd i would expect a better wifi the food menu wants to be fancy with small portions and higher prices than all the other hotel weve been to and the taste is very average i am travelling with my wife and our  years old for a month in indonesia we have always booked for  adults only as my daughter is sleeping in our bed and as we share our breakfast for a month no hotel asked us to pay for an extra breakfast except in katamaran i guess its they right but it is kind of a dck move to make us pay usd for a  years old breakfast pastry and  watery juice over all nothing horrible you can stay there its fine but except the view the rest is average definitely not the highlight of our trip,Katamaran Hotel & Resort,NTB,Urban
5.0,my wife and i spent dn at the katamaran resort and i will tell you we would return without hesitation the property is clean spacious and has a great atmosphere that is not to say there were not a few hiccups our first room which was spacious modern well appointed and clean was on the rd floor near a wing of the resort that was being renovated we woke to sound loud construction noise and an elevator that had been shutoff to accommodate the construction upon notifying the front desk they checked with management and got the okay to move us to a new room at breakfast one day the ice water had dirt in it and we told the staff they got us bottled water but the staff needed to check with management to see if they would need to charge us for the bottled water which they didnt our suggestion to the management team and ownership at katamaran is to empower their staff to excel at customer service to solve these minor issues without having to involve management to highlight some of the very positive service from the staff we have to shout out hasan and haqi who were some of the friendliest and best bar staff at the kilft they were so kind and took such good care of us we hated to leave a final shout out to irawan and madi the chef that prepared our very special bbq dinner on the beach overall we highly recommend the katamaran and lombok if you want to see bali and indonesia without the hustle and bustle of over crowded beaches,Katamaran Hotel & Resort,NTB,Urban

5.0,we are very happy with our stay at the katamaran very helpful staff nothing was too much trouble right on the beach which was very handy large rooms with good views fantastic pools tasty food our room had an outdoor rain shower which i used everyday loved it the hotel is very well maintained and the grounds are immaculate my only small grizzle was the limited range of local breakfast choices the fully cooked continental range was great but when i travel i always want to experience local food also i felt the tax and service charges were a bit excessive compared to other places also a few other guests complained about it as well but hey i would differently stay here again we really enjoyed ourselves and it was the relaxing break we needed,Katamaran Hotel & Resort,NTB,Urban
5.0,we have just recently returned from  nights at katamaran seeing the new year in here and i can honestly say its one of the best hotels we have ever stayed inwe had a ocean view villa room which was stunning very spacious with a lovely huge bathroom only down point was the lighting was quite dark  for a woman doing her make up can be slightly frustrating but the room was very clean and the bed was really comfortable it had plenty of wardrobe space and the air conditioning was very goodthe food was of a very high standard breakfast had a fantastic selection of food asian continental and american choices the lunch and evening menu was varied and again the food was fantastic we partiuclaly loved the hawaiian burgerthe service and staff were brilliant so friendly and attentive nothing was too much for themthe location is slightly out of the main area of senggigi however the taxis are so cheap this was not a problem and only about a  min drive awayall the locals we spoke to said this was now the best hotel in the area and from what we saw we would have to agree would most definitely return to this hotel,Katamaran Hotel & Resort,NTB,Urban

4.0,cant fault the property  the rooms are amazing we love the decor the aquarium pool is fun and instagrammable we enjoyed our walks on the beach food served at both the hotel restaurants are delicious try the pizza at the kliff theyre the bestthe only downside is that service is slow in most areas our check in and out food took ages to be served,Katamaran Hotel & Resort,NTB,Urban
4.0,the staff were very accommodating when there was an issue with our allocated room if you are booking katamaran use agents bookingcom etc at your perilgenerally the service was very good however the room service menu is quite limited and alcohol is very expensive i would advise getting a bluebird cab just across the road from the hotel into senggigi town about five mins away and stocking up or hit up duty free on your way overthe breakfast is fantastic with a broad selection on offer and good coffee which weve found hard to track down in indothe beach is totally stunning and reasonably clean  wander down the beach to nuf said warung and hire a snorkel to have a look idr for two as opposed to k each from hotel we saw turtles fish and some fairly impressive corallaundry and massages available next door and down the road from hotel are great and significantly cheapernote that the infinity pool villa with ocean view is on the ground floor and not totally private guests can seewalk into your pool and outdoor area from main pool and seating areas and the ocean view is interrupted by seatingswings accessible to all guestsoverall we would be back and recommend this hotel,Katamaran Hotel & Resort,NTB,Urban

5.0,stayed in the private pool br villa very spacious and the pool was adequately sized the villa bathrooms were a bit quirky for me since they have no doors hence no privacy at all probably not a problem for honeymooners but otherwise it could get awkward the compound was large with two wellmaintained pool complexes directly overlooking the ocean plenty of instaworthy photo spots near the pool and public areas not all areas are wheelchair friendly so keep it in mind when traveling with senior citizens spa experience was wonderful and reasonably priced mbak ramlah in soulbliss spa took good care of me breakfast option was limited and after a while it got boring there is also plenty room for improvement for the service personnel especially in the front desk not very efficient and not very welcoming but overall i enjoyed my stay and would not mind coming back for another visit,Katamaran Hotel & Resort,NTB,Urban

4.0,resort is beautiful modern and clean staff were great and very helpful when we had a small problem pools are awesome great views from most rooms and breakfast was also good although no bacon xfxfxxf negatives are some of the linen as in towels old and sometimes it seemed it was dirty but im hoping it wasnt prices for drinks were exorbitant for example  large bintang at bar was  approx  and next door at a small restaurant they were  approx so very big difference  so in fact its much cheaper to drink a bintang in australia and dare not ask for a whiskey food also pricey but you can go next door at nufsaid warung or down the road for cheaper meals a very quiet area with not a lot happening so if thats what your after thats very good place but if you want excitement its maybe not for you try maybe gili trawangan,Katamaran Hotel & Resort,NTB,Urban
5.0,this time exploring lombok and we choose katamaran definitely best choice that we made its luxury and has best view beachfront their glass wall main pool become its signature landmark and the view over the beach was amazing we stay at private pool villa and its really private you can do whatever but the air con is not too cold i assume its not cover the area of rooms as its only  but not big issue breakfast also good and enough variety definitely will back to katamaran,Katamaran Hotel & Resort,NTB,Urban

5.0,i initially thought this was a small boutique resort but its actually quite large good variation in room types but all seem to have at least a partial view of the ocean breakfast is a site to behold they cater for everyone i stayed a few nights then went on to gili islands i came back for one night and the staff arranged for an upgraded room  they are super friendly and genuine the big plus for me was being able to leave the balcony door open and have the fresh sea air filling the room each night,Katamaran Hotel & Resort,NTB,Urban
5.0,you cant get perfection on earth but this place is something that gets as close as possible to it we had  wonderful days enjoying our twobedroom suite the truly wonderful and varied breakfasts and the nice ocean view from the pools its a place where well certainly come back however the management can get even closer to perfection if they could address a couple of issues that have been deeply annoying at least to us  the music in the pool areas clashes with the peaceful surrounding while a sort of lounge music could still make sense the continuous nonsense of pop music is totally out of place most of the people coming to such wonderful places might prefer to listen to the sound of waves rather than to the last summer hits those who like them usually go to,Katamaran Hotel & Resort,NTB,Urban

3.0,lets start with strong points as there are not many  the hotel is quite new located in the best part of senggigi beach with a nice sea view rooms are spacious but materials used and the furnishing look cheap quality of service is really dissapointing  in the restaurant although there are not many guests you need to wait  minutes until a waiter notices you and collects your order then  minutes after your drinks are served if you are lucky and then you need only  minutes more to get you food describing the food asnot impressive is a very lenient verdict breakfasts are mediocre and the kliffs restaurant western european dishes taste like a cheap fast food needless to say everything is massively overpriced yes i have a comparison with similar standard,Katamaran Hotel & Resort,NTB,Urban

4.0,spent two night breathtaking location gorgeous spacious room very comfy bed breakfast was included had lots of choices amazing food the cost of food and drink was very high with per cent service charge so we only had one drink there what a disaster that was  mins we had to wait there was only one table with customers on had to go back to bar to ask for drinks as we had a table booked at another restaurant was advised drinks were prepared inside they went in and told the staff  mins later a young waitress came out to us to say the drinks were being prepared i asked to cancel the order as we needed to leave she said that we couldnt as they were being made after such a wonderful stay this did spoil our experience which is such a shame definitely need to,Katamaran Hotel & Resort,NTB,Urban
3.0,the hotel is very good such a relaxing atmosphere you have an amazing ocean view from everywhere and great pools the food near the pool was delicious however i wold not advise anybody to eat main dishes at kliff restaurant both my husband and me were poisoned by paella mixta there that dish had a weird taste we didnt eat outside the hotel at all so i can be sure that it was paella mixta i told the manager as soon as it happened that im not going to pay for this dish however he did nothing and included it in our bill so when we were checking out we encountered this unpleasant issue and i asked again to subtract it from our bill they started to think what to do and it took so long and we had to go to the airport that i just left   rp less unfortunately,Katamaran Hotel & Resort,NTB,Urban

1.0,kila is a large hotel with a nice beach access unfortunately they let themselves down with excessively loud beach music and staff that only care about partyingwe stayed in a beach hut which was quite dated but very close to the beach which we thought would be a bonus unfortunately it turned out to be anything but the staff set up a large band area and excessively loud music starts at around pm with even more annoying sounds check before we asked the staff to control the volume as we couldnt hear ourselves think even inside our room but the staff were more interested in enjoying the music at one point hardly any guest were listening but they persisted playing at a volume that the speakers couldnt even handle the management should tconsider their guests more than their staff parties,Kila Senggigi Beach Lombok,NTB,Urban

3.0,this was the second hotel of our  hotel honeymoon and honestly was a total disappointment the room itself was fine if slightly small and the grounds of the hotel are very nice but everything else is a let down at breakfast every single paper tablecloth was dirty the toilet in our bathroom was leaking which we reported and although it did seem to slightly improve after that it wasnt ever completely fixed the staff at breakfast and at the restaurant and the bar were lovely but the staff at reception were not hugely welcoming also we were scammed by a local travel agent who we ended up having a heated discussion with in the reception area but none of the staff offered any assistance and it was clear they all know the agent personally at the end we couldnt wait to get off of lombok,Kila Senggigi Beach Lombok,NTB,Urban
5.0,this is the second time we have stayed at kila senggigi they have by far the best beach to swim at in lombok that i have been to so far the staff are all very lovely and welcoming the rooms are probably due for an upgrade but who spends a lot of time in them anyway the property itself is so spacious and beautiful and very conveniently located a couple of minutes walk up to the main road were there is a large selection of restaurants and bars to choose fromthe restaurants are pretty deserted until about pm onwards and some only open at pm or later so it looks like a bit of a ghost town until then it definitely comes alive once the sun goes downi had an amazing massage at the resorts purnama spa the ladies were fabulous and actually knew how to do a massage and reflexology properly compared to some of the spas in the areaall in all a great resort for everyone,Kila Senggigi Beach Lombok,NTB,Urban

3.0,the kila has beautifully manicured gardens and seem to take pride in keeping their resort well maintained we booked a bungalow room with a beach view i admit we booked one of the last bungalows left but were given a bungalow with a view of the restaurant which blocked our view to the sea it also meant the live band that played there every night was literally like they were playing in your room as there is no sound proofing whatsoever disappointing but not a deal breaker for us plus we got really good at guessing their song lineup haha the room itself was good nice bed great patio area to hang out on but the bathroom left much to be desired while the bathroom was fine and did the job we did expect a little more for what we paid for its a bit run down and the shower head was literally just a stream of water like a tap sometimes the toilet didnt flush properlythe buffet breakfast was pretty standard with some nice indonesian food on offer fresh fruit and some delicious pancakes however you had to be careful not to go to the breakfast too late or they ran out of some of the food their pastries were pretty dry and bland so we didnt really bother but they made great omelettes and even had some nice bircher muesli the hotel restaurant was surprisingly italian which is a little disappointing because wed prefer to eat the local food the food was quite over priced considering how small the portions were nevertheless a nice spot to sit and enjoy the beach and people watchingotherwise the staff were always friendly and welcoming to us and overall we had a very enjoyable stay the pool area was nice and we also enjoyed lounging over near the beach as well the beach had some nice snorkelling that is worth doing if you have the time as the hotel hires out snorkelling gear by the hour the location was great too  right near the main strip of shops in sengiggi which allowed us to explore the local food and shops,Kila Senggigi Beach Lombok,NTB,Urban

4.0,we were going on a roundtrip and happened to come to kila senggigi of our  hotels this and one more were on the top the minuses are primarily two or three it should be a non smoking hotel compound the minority of smokers destroy too much for the majority non smokers even the vendors outside the restaurant inside were smoking the other problem for us was that the cooking in the inside restaurang didnt seem to have professional staff even the italian seemed to need upgraded chef indonesia is a tragic dirt hole except kila senggigi and similar places but kila should have staff looking after the beach we gave them a hand but it is a never ending problem if not a movement like keep indonesia and the oceans clean,Kila Senggigi Beach Lombok,NTB,Urban

4.0,been to lombok a few times and we always stayed at the sheraton however we decided on kila this time round after we are unable to secure any rooms at the sheraton due to an unusual fullhouse bookings nevertheless we were surprised at how good kila is although it is incomparable to sheraton but at the less pricey price this resort actually delivered beyond our expectations upon arrival we were warmly received by the staff checkin was quite efficient and although there was an issue with our bookings the staff managed to resolve it promptly we had reserved a deluxe sea view room with a private balcony that faced a lovely lawn and the beach was just about  metres away i spent most of the nights in the balcony reading a book and sipping coffee at the balcony while enjoying the cool sea breeze the room was a bit dated but clean and rustic which we actually preferred while staying in a beach resort the room and the bathroom are spacious we were happy with the room size staff were overall very friendly and every one of them smiled and greeted us as we walked past them we had breakfast at the rinjani restaurant every morning it was a buffet spread although not as wide spread as sheraton the spread was actually just nice and the quality of food was surprisingly quite good we did had a bbq buffet dinner on one of the night at the basilico italian pavilion restaurant  bar but its a bit underwhelming so its advisable to have your dinner at the senggigi village which is just a  minutes walk and there are many options of good restaurants at the village the location of kila was actually more accessible to nearby convenience stores shops and restaurants than sheraton kila senggigi beach is highly recommended based on location pricing and the resort itself,Kila Senggigi Beach Lombok,NTB,Urban
1.0,egoist attitude when i first check in then we trying to ask for opinion about place of interest and etc their staffs attitude is like im troubling them egoist i would say until i try to please them by saying their hotel is very nice and lovely of course i didnt mean that then at least they help me a little,Kila Senggigi Beach Lombok,NTB,Urban

4.0,myself and my partner have just got back from an incredible  night stay herethe resort is gorgeous and had a really relaxed atmospherenot many downsides at all but it is a shame the hotel is not closer to any restaurants and bars unfortunately there really isnt anything within walking distanceanother negative is that the hotels restaurant is not nosmoking its very off putting when youre trying to enjoy a nice meal and the tables next to you are smoking one guy even had a pipe that said the food in the restaurant is varied and deliciouswe also used the spa while we were there and although the hotel got the time confused and we were a little rushed the massage was incredible and i wish we had gone sooner and more oftenthe rooms feel very authentically indonesian however could probably do with a lick of paint,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

3.0,i am part of the group of divers with max i just want to feedback on the food standard and the restaurant serviceby my experience i ordered the same menu item tom yum soup over  days and each time i was served a different version of the soup only on the rd day was the tom yum soup of an acceptable tom yum standard and the rest of the food on the day were good as well of course we were happy and we highlighted our compliments to the chef to the restaurant staff then food standards drop again for the rest of the stay including indonesian food to my disappointment and im not the kind who like to waste food so i did try to finish my orders every time but really do try to maintain a consistent food standard pleaseon the restaurant service over the course of the stay very frequently the restaurant staff mixed up our orders or keep forgetting or did not follow up on our orders i first experienced this on my first night when i check in later than the main group it is frustrating when i am kept waiting for my order even when the main dining crowd has already left this i cannot comprehend however there is that one chap whose service compared to the rest is way exceptional he is the only one that keep checking with us if our food is ok keep topping up our water jug etc his service is genuine and thoughtful and we thank him for that,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,this is a off the beaten track but still close by it has therefore managed to keep authenticity and charm views across the ocean towards the gilis are breathtaking premises are spatious clean scenic and well kept even antimosquito measures once a weekthe resort and diving centre offer many excursions i recommend a diving or snorkling trip across the islands which are the main attraction on this side of lombok make sure you book quickly during high seasoni did not get a chance to test the spa but it seemed well kept and i wont expect it to dissapointthis is really an unique place and i recommend to visit it soon its has everything you want and still a bit undiscovered and the southern gilis are breathtaking paradise islandsroom tip we had  connecting rooms ultra handy with  young kids and an infant ask for a room or cottage towards the sea away from a bit if street noise in the morning,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
3.0,visit this resort for a dn for diving with a few friends and realise that it is quite similar with the one at manado room is reasonably size and well maintain although i will prefer some part of it to be a little more well lighted in order to fix up my diving equipment one down side of resort will be the service and restaurant food we arrive at the resort with no one in sight for a good  mins and wonder around the lobby with our luggage thinking what to do most of the restaurant service staff is very friendly and helpful but there is a few that pull down the overall service and the food that i wanted to comment most is that there is no consistency on it the same dish we order can have various version and some of it taste really horrible we really struggle with the meal we had each day and pray each day the right chef is at work hygiene is another issue at the restaurant one of my friend got a mild diarrhoea during the trip due to the food the water jug cover is serve to us with mould on it which i hope they will look into this matter attached photo dive center overall service is excellent with friendly and helpful crew,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

4.0,the hotels location is brilliant with a great view of the tiny islands and you can see mt rinjani on a clear day the rooms are clean and nice and all the staff are very pleasant and helpfulthe food is very good especially since there arent many places around the resort to eat if your looking for a holiday to unwind and relax this is just the perfect location to do so but if your looking to do some sightseeing near mataram and further north this is quite far off and you may not be able to cover all the places in a daythey do have guide to take you diving but there wasnt a dive instructor for us to learn diving  this could have been since there werent many people in the resort this decemberoverall the place worked for us just because of the location and food,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

5.0,spent a few days here postrinjani a wonderful way to chill out after the climb great pool nice beach and clean spacious rooms staff were incredibly friendly as wellit is a bit removed from other places and activities  so be prepared to spend lots of time at the resort but with an attached restaurant pool and dive centre thats not too bad,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

4.0,the hotel is not so big and quite isolated a car or bike to reach the first important town is necessary the atmosphere at the hotel is lovely and warm the personnel is very very kind and efficient they know how to make you feel good the only restaurant is nice looking in front of the sea and dishes are good we really had a good time at this hotel there is a little swimming pool and it takes only  minutes to be at nanngu island in front of the cocotinos it is a good hotel if you want to make sub i have been here for my honeymoon everything was fantasitic but there are only to remarks to be done in my opinion at night a little entertainment should be offered something like soft music or a little show after dinner there is nothing to do at my arrival at the hotel i got the key of the room but after really few minutes i realised that it was really noisy because near to the road motorbikes and cars really bothered people staying in those rooms and especially if you are on honeymoon you need a little bit of peacein any case rooms are nice quite big with ac and tvfinally i can say that my experience at cocotinos has been nice,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
4.0,we spent four nights at the cocotinos resort in augustit was a very relaxing stay the hotel is small well kept the rooms are very big and cleanthis is the perfect place to visit the nearby beautiful islands and do some amazing snorkeling there or diving the hotel is quite isolated and since we did not have our own mode of transportation we decided to have all the meals there the restaurant is ok but of course much more expensive than everywhere else on the island there is also a nice free teacoffeesnacks time every afternoonthe beach is clean although nothing special but it is nice that you can go snorkeling from the peer and see many fishes and corals the people from the snorkelingdiving center were very friendly and we loved the trips that they organized but again prices are quite high compared to the averagethey have free activities such as visit to the market and traditional villages we did not take them instead we wanted to visit a nearby beach and they were so nice to bring us there and come later to pick us up for freeall in all we enjoyed very much our stay there were only two problems with the hotel and thats way i do not give them  starsthe main problem was the poor understanding of english of most of the staff often it was really a problem to be communicatethe second problem was the limited number of sunbeds by the beachpool once everyone comes back from the boat trips they are definitively not enough,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,i stopped here for lunch with a group of people the food was really good i ended up needing a room for a night so i decided to stay here it was surprisingly close to american prices to stay and eat here the room was just what i needed wasnt too fancy even with the price tag but it was a safe clean place to lay my head i even got to checkout a little later than the normal time without any additional fee i had the complimentary breakfast which was great much better than most continental breakfasts id recommend staying here,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

3.0,we stayed here for  nights this place was rather secluded and took one hour to get there from the airport they have around  rooms with a big and lush garden the room is spacious enough yet not very well noiseproofing as we could still hear the sounds from the rooms next to us as well as the noises of motorbikes on the main street the resort has their own big swimming pool beach and jetty and you can snorkel right there you will see some big school of fish giant blue starfish and some corals as we did the resort location is also convenient for daily snorkeling tour to nearby and faraway islands its best if you can avoid taking the tours on sunday as it will be pretty crowded on those islands making the snorkeling less enjoyable we didnt choose the service provider from the resort given their much higher price tag whilst the values were more less the same as offered by nearby fishermen and villagers despite our not using the resorts service staff was still helpful to organize the tours for usthe resorts food was decent we ate here all the time as there were not many options nearby id suggest its safe to stick to the chefs recommended menu except the balinese meal set they used too much chicken  which wasnt specified on the menu and the courses were not well cooked imho for other courses i found seafood much better cooked than chicken duck the latter was made very dry so that we couldnt taste the meat texture anymorestaff was friendly and helpful most of the time however when there were some needs for troubleshooting they were quite confused we needed to wake up quite early on the last  days for a diving trip and b checking out to go to bangsal port given the restaurant wouldnt open until  am we were offered breakfast boxes for both days the boxes included chicken sandwiches with some fruits we were disappointed as soon as we opened the box we found some ants crawling inside despite we immediately showed that to the receptionist on the first day it happened again on the second day we showed it to the receptionist again and gave up given we were checking out it then soon followed by another disappointment before going to lombok we booked the resort shuttle service certainly not cheap but we wanted to be sure to take us to bangsal port at  am on the checkout day but the driver was late for nearly  given we needed to show up there on time to catch a boat we doublechecked with a receptionist the night before the person ensured everything was arranged but then happened the incident when we came to the reception at  am the first thing he asked me to do was to pay for the shuttle service despite the driver wasnt there yet the receptionist made many calls and couldnt answer our question as to why the driver was late he kept moving between the desk and the back room without any explanation that made us even more nervous luckily we didnt miss our boat at bangsal but that gave us a heart attackoverall we had a decent stay however these incidents shouldnt have happened given the resort has operated for  years for the price tags quoted by the resort we expected a higher standard in service delivery,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
3.0,the staff are lovely helpful and speak english our bedroom  bathroom was clean and good standard very peaceful resort yet literally nothing else nearby we were meant to stay  nights but moved to kuta on the second morning the food was bland tasteless which is where we struggled with the thought of staying the whole weekend the beach is actually about m long not m photos were very deceptive the sea was unswimmable due to coral reef the sand was not raked and therefore not pretty white but full of seaweed the lombok website states mins from airport it took us hours there is lots of potential here but the owners lacking focus on the finer details had a massage which was lovely i rarely write reviews and never had to switch places before therefore felt important to share our experience as the website is deceptive in our opinion,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
4.0,its location is in a superb area beachfront with blue waters  a pier there is also a center for your snorkeldiving needs sufficient deck beds  canopy for you relax  sun tan as for food you do not have any choice chefs skills are not fantastic my familys experience w their seafood is that fish meat are mushy  fishy tasting  my brother experience diarrhea after eating seafood basically if you are hoping to have a wonderful dinning experience with food  view complimenting each other the food is an utter disappointment there is no convenient store within walking distance to buy anything,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

4.0,the people at the hotel were wonderfully friendly and keen to help the food was excellent the beachfront villa made it very special maybe less so in a standard room the location is very remote so you have to be prepared to just chill out at the hotel and do boat trips  which was fine for us only negative the extremely expensive rates for diving  twice the cost of diving in menjanagn island in bali,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

4.0,really cute place with nicely decorated rooms that keep to the funky theme i was surprised that the food was actually really good wouldnt recommend their western main dishes but asian dishes and salads were great and breakfast was good the staff were really helpful and spoke perfect english there isnt much to do at the hotel so we just used it as a base and didnt spend anytime there in the day the beach infront of the resort is nothing spectacular but the islands are only mins away the only complaint advice i have is regarding the dive centre on site they charge usd million rupiah for a boat to the neighbouring  islands hours which is outrageous as i knew that the price should only be k the staff at reception were kind enough to call the local fishermen at the nearly tawun harbour and they came to pick us up and we got a private boat to the islands for k for the day including transfer back and all proceeds go the the locals rather than a company i have the contact of the guy now so can share if required,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
4.0,i visited others cocotinos comparison the staff are shy n dare not to speak much except the dive crew they are fun n helpful may be the hotel staff need more advice or training food are standard since lombok is full of seafood i suggest that more flexible for seafood for example i would like to order more seafood from the fish market this has not been arranged general fish dishes in the restaurant are fresh even for us who are fussy in the freshness of the seafood,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

4.0,beautiful resort pool area right on the ocean with a breathtaking view staff in the restaurant was very friendly and chatty we booked a rebate package online felt wierd because resort was relatively empty and they still put us in a bungalow in the very back close to the road seperated by a high wall but you could hear it well kept grounds very relaxing and enjoyable food was good reception and staff perfect just a very very beautiful secluded nice place only wierd thing was that the guy from the dive shop was rather keen on selling us a snorkeling trip even though we wanted to go diving in the end we did neither and just chilled at the pool yes i can recommend staying here,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

2.0,not a very pleasant experience for me started with unfriendly respond from front desk i called whether a late check for any one of the  rooms that we booked since i was going to dive with their odyssea dive centre only to be answered we cant give promise you that because you only stay for one night and we have high occupancy you have to try during your check in i initially appreciated they gave a late check out in one of the room when i checked in considering the high occupancy rate as they claimed only to find more let down to find out they also put a sale on  rooms at idr  million when i booked for almost idr  million for  millionthe odyssea dive centre was also unorganized and close to rude i called a week before to book for  dives and they assured me to just drop by when i arrive there and they will have it arranged turned out they were fully booked when i came and blame it on me for not booking earlier they also made it as if i shouldnt dive as my flight is the next day and i have less than  hours after the dive which is contrary to the schedule they put on the table pretty unconsistent and rude i didnt have my padi card which eventually they use as an excuse which is fine if it was the reason i couldnt dive,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

4.0,this is a lovely resort with a beach in lombok we had a swim at the beach and there was some leaves floating in the water but no rubbish the staff were friendly and considering it was ramadan we ate a couple of nice local simple treatsi was pleased that there were police stationed outside during our visit from a cruise ship as one of the cruise staff was mugged in lombok i would love to come back here to stay if we thought that our culture would be in some way respected,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,a last minute decision turned out to be a glorious relaxing time everything about cocotinos was fabby  from the lovely rooms beautiful scenery and smiling happy staff we visited in the off season and pretty much had the place to ourselves  its been a true delight,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
3.0,we love how this place was set up the room was beautiful and very comfortable five star for the resort itself the staff were polite we had no issue with anyone we got the dn diveandstay package but i must say we were not too happy about itfirst of all they did not brief us anything about diving when we arrived they pointed out where the dive shop was and it was up to us to talk to the dive people when we got there again very polite divemasters however nothing was explained no time was set and we had to ask everything and confirm everything they did not seem to be enthusiastic about the dive and didnt ask us what we wanted to see this is quite different from everywhere else weve dived so far but i must say that once we went diving it was good the dive masters were active and showed us a lot of nice creatures we do appreciate thatsecondly there is a lot of good reviews about the food here which we really do not agree with my partner got a stomach bug on the first night here the staffs were apologetic and tried to make it up by not charging us some soft drinks and juices and let us order from the normal menu we had a allinclusive package which consist of  or  mains on menu even in comparison to the street indonesian food we ate the restaurant is below average there were fishermen fishing off the beach everyday yet all of the seafood was frozen on the flip side the juices are greatthirdly the trash on the beach and in the water i understand this isnt really the fault of the resort as trash washes onto the beach and they do try to clean it every morning however they should clean it more often because by midday there are already more trash the worst thing for a beach resort is that the beach is trashy and no one wants to swim in it we went to the pier to look and there were hundreds of plastic bags of all sort floating around trash disrupts the beauty of nature i would advise to do clean up more often than what they are doing nowand lastly the internet it does not work in the room and we had to keep on changing the username and password because none of them worked it also goes in and out seems like they are very protective of their internet while everywhere else in lombok advertises free internet and we can get it without any problemi would recommend this place if you have a couple of days to relax but try to find somewhere else to eat,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
4.0,had a pleasant stay at coconinos food was very good and seafood was fresh fish caught at pm and served at dinner as according to our waiter service was prompt and staff was helpful however our quiet getaway was disturbed by kevin a lone monkey without a tribe kevin broke a glass i left outside on the balcony setting lose the hermit crabs i caught to show my kids tore up my beach pants i set out to dry tore through the insect screen in the pantry and took our milk bottle brush kevin sneered at the kids and i had a brief moment of eye contact with him when i set out for him from the commotion i could not bare being ridiculed and made fun of by this primate and i ambushed kevin in the dark i heard kevin rustling in the bushes however i never got the chance to alpha duel with kevinalso mattress need replacingi still see kevin when i close my eyes,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

3.0,the beach was beautiful on the first day and the view from breakfast is amazing but once you get close to the water you can see lots of trash floating we enjoyed the boat to gili nangu but there was also trash in the water there the service was okay theres no where to go so you have to eat at the hotel the food was good but they were out of many dishes each night i asked for help finding a pharmacy nearby but the front desk clerk wasnt able to help i also asked about the free shuttle into the nearby villages written in the hotel information book in the room he had no idea what i was talking about wifi is difficult and slow,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

4.0,we chose this resort for a secluded relaxing getaway the beach front villa was great clean and well appointed comfortable kind size bed great wifi beautiful large bathroom with both an indoor and outdoor shower and a huge stone bath we found the restaurant to be simple with tasty food i personally loved the banana pancakes for breakfast and classic nasi goreng for dinner we ordered room service to have on our deck and spent plenty of time floating in the private plunge pool or relaxing on the day bed we utilised the divingsnorkelling service available at the resort that took us over to one of the lesser known gilis and had a good experience visibility wasnt great on the day we also had a private yoga session under the jetty cabana at sunrise which was a fantastic experience the resort is definitely a small boutique resort but we loved that aspect and the peace and quiet we travelled in may ,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
4.0,went to the restaurant to celebrate my birthday we were the only guests and the service was good food and drink comparatively expensive for the area but the food itself very variable whilst the soup was excellent the sirloin steak dezspite being classified as imported was extremely tough  fortunately a dog was nearby so he was lucky to get a fair share of it,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
2.0,i must admit the resort makes fantastic impression and the rooms are beautiful but we did not stay there i just took my wife for a romantic dinner on one of the evenings in december  so this opinion is just about the restaurantwe ordered two drinks they were ok nothing amazing two entrees very small yet good ceasar salad was very delicate lacked character but was good orange carrot soup could have used more spices  still ok the real disaster happened with the main course beef rendang was chewy to the extent we gave half of it to the stray dog yes in the resort that charges you  for a dinner you have a stray dog in the restaurantbut i am not yet finished another position in the menu we decided to take was gulai kambing a lamb stew that should be delicate we gave pieces my wife really couldnt chew to the dog i tried it and it was almost as bad as my beefand i would never write this review if not for the bill they added  tax and surcharges it is not mentioned in the menu or of it is it is hidden which was  sorry but just for that i can eat better meal in a local warungbeware  card terminal does not work bring cash so very disappointed i do not recommend this place,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

4.0,cocotinos sekotong is a wonderful place to spend time in lombok its off the beaten tourist track but has everything you might want  an amazing pool lovely rooms beautiful surrounding environment and friendly staff a highlight was our snorkelling day trip the only thing that isnt star is the food which was ok but not to the high standard of the rest of cocotinos and there arent many other options around,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
3.0,the resort is very nice but the service is scarce and breakfast is very poor around the resort there is nothing you cant go out in the evening and after dinner the only thing to do is going to bed,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
4.0,we stayed as a family of  with  year children and our balinese au pair and had a very enjoyable stay with mostly pros and just a few cons which i am mentioning so that other travellers know what to expect the location is beautiful and the resort is very well maintained rooms are very nice clean and well equipped the pool is excellent and was very popular with the kids the beach is clean and we enjoyed the beachcombing seeing fish and sea life my kids unfortunately didnt really yet manage to enjoy the snorkelling but i am sure that if yours do then it would be paradise  my husband reported that the snorkelling was really good the staff were very friendly and always tried to be helpful but some patience is required because the service can tend to be a little too relaxed at times and my children are not so patient the food is reasonable the breakfast is fine but not exciting there is a good choice of both asian and western foods and certainly enough kidfriendly options pasta pizza burgers fish and chips i did think that the cooking of the meat and fish tended towards being overdone which may be because of the climate i did spend a day in bed with diarrhoea swallowing immodium after i asked for the tuna to be less cooked but the vegetables were always nice and crunchy we tried the rijstafel on the last night and it was very disappointing  terrible tough and stringy meat and boring sauces but they did refund  which was much appreciatedoverall i would only recommend a stay of  days max with younger children it is isolated  peaceful and serene but the downside is that it takes about    hours to get there from the airport there is not so much for younger children to do if yours do not want to snorkel all the time you have to eat every meal in the hotel and after a few days you start to feel like you are getting to know the menu rather well it is probably even better for couples seeking to chill out for days and do nothinggenerally where our stay fell done most for me personally was the value for money which was somewhat disappointing in comparison to bali where we stayed the week before  the food was slightly more expensive and not such good quality the  service charge on top of everything was pretty hefty and i am not sure it all went to the staff and for a family of  you need to rent  rooms and at  euros a night a stay really starts to add up plus the prices of the soft drinks are  times the price in local supermarkets and the hotel makes a  profit in organising local transport  i saw that another reviewer was given a free airport shuttle but we had to pay for our own transport to and from the airport at the end you do start to feel that they are extracting every penny that they can but i guess that this is the price for staying in high season with guaranteed sunshine every day,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,a perfect hide out for nature lovers the location is so serene and completely relaxing staffs were very attentive and friendly and i love the welcome drink served by the resort room is excellent spacious with day bed i am impressed by their spa service and i truly adore the outdoor spa room concept which is located by the seashore trekked through the hill located right opposite the resort and i am amazed by the magnificent views of sekotong bay one of the best dish i had here was called rijsttafel it is a selection of local dishes which includes curry tofu rendang beef gulai mutton opor chicken and sweet  sour prawn the portion served is really hugei totally enjoyed my stay here enjoyed the tranquility of mother natures work around this place,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
3.0,we had a pleasant stay for  days in cocotinos but for the rate we paid about  a night you would expect more in other  hotels like mariott and radisson in the indonesian region you pay less but get much more and more professional service staff here dont really understand what service means they have been trained to say sorry and good morningafternoonevening numerous times a day though trained politeness nobody to welcome you when you arrive by car and take your luggage the checking in took too long and reception desk wasnt always manned not to talk about the restaurant theres not much in the surrounding area so youll probably eat in the restaurant the only decent meal we had in  lunches   dinners  dishes in total was the tuna steak every meal the staff managed to make an average of  mistakes variing from wrong drinks to forget to leave out specific ingredients on request part of the dish was often cold the fact that service charge is included in the bill doesnt make the staff eager to improve after complains at check out we were assisted by a very helpful lady who did understand and after apologies deducted the  service charge of our bill if all staff were like herrooms are nice bit too much detail for me im more of a minimalist but thats taste i think most ppl will regard them as warm and cosypool is great beach location also good for swimming beach is clean with nice soft sand in the morning you have to hurry if you want a sunbed which for this rate everyone should be entitled to have one because there is a shortage of them and some guests have the tendency to block sunbeds with their towels to use them only a fraction of the day the staff could also do something about it when the policy would be set up to avoid this from happeningthe breakfast could be categorized as fantastic with plenty of choice unlimited pancakes egg yoghurt fruits toast cheese sausage and local dishes to make it perfect i would like to see some fresh bread but you cant please all ,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

3.0,we spent three days at cocotinos with a group of friends and have mixed feelings about the place the staff was friendly as most indonesians are but the service overall was horrible the rooms were nice nothing special but no complaintswhile we like that it was remote and secluded the food was inconsistent average to below average as were the drinks more below average than average there are really no other options for fooddrinks around the hotel which makes the secluded nature of the resort less of a benefitthey will also try and charge you twice as much as a taxi for pick up and drop off at the airport which is somewhat standard with other hotels but given it is much harder to find taxis you are almost forced to use their drop off service when you want to return to the airportwe tried to work with the hotel on arranging a snorkeling day trip we talked to them three different times both before arrival and upon arrival the morning we got up to snorkel and went to find our boat they informed us there were no available this was pretty frustrating given we had talked to them several times about it luckily they were able to call someone who had a boat and was willing to take us out for the day it took another hour or so for the boat to show up but it was worth itthe snorkel around the secret gilis is nice but its the lack of tourists on the islands that make the trip to them worth it there are a few restaurants which offer grilled fish beer and sideswell worth itoverall i would probably opt to stay in kuta or senggigi if the service improved to include the quality of food and drinks it might be worth the trip back but until then i dont plan on returning,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,this is second time we had a stay with this hotel i believe this hotel is still the only one hotel with proper  star facility in this area and it was still awesome we had no complaint for the room also breakfast was as good as usual though the variety was not much the room service was great the food quality was okay i keen to have stay here again for our next trip,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,this was the first stop on our lombok honeymoon trip and we were not disappointedwe arrived just as the sun was going down and the tide was out but even still the view and the beach looked wonderful its about a  hour drive from the airportthe check in process was friendly and easy and we were shown to our room which had its own plunge pool overlooking the sea this part of our journey had been booked for us by our travel agent and i had paid extra for the upgrade to the pool room which was well worth it the room was large and had an indoor bathroom with a huge bath in it and an outside shower room double doors led from the bedroom to an outside seating area with a day bed and then onto a small deck with the pool next to itthe restaurant at the hotel is very good and offers a range of meals but the lobster was probably the best breakfast is served in the same area and offers a good choice including freshly baked bread and pancakes to name but a fewduring our stay we didnt do very much other than to relax as it was quite hot so the plunge pool was used often in order to cool offthere is a pier located just off the beach and the hotel has a dive centre which we didnt us sunrise is more dramatic than sunset and a walk up the beach should not be missed as there are no other hotels in this vicinity and therefore its very privateall in all a lovely we had a lovely time and we would certainly visit the hotel again,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

4.0,cocotinos is a small resort tucked away in sw lombok we thoroughly enjoyed our  night stay there we would like to compliment cocotinos on their outstanding service and friendliness of the staff we were made to feel welcome from the minute we were picked up from desert point lodge by their driver the restaurant cleaning gardening and administration staff were all amazing our room was spotless and while we reported the bathroom door was a bit sticky and couldnt be shut easily the staff were straight onto it to try and fix it for us food at the restaurant was very good although we believed the chefs over cooked all the protein  fish chicken and beef we ate not badly so but certainly could have had less time being heated the  trips we took out with the onsite diving company to snorkel around the gillis were excellent value especially when compared to the spa treatments which we thought were overpriced compared to other resorts on lombok we did receive a free massage of  minutes from the spa as part of our staythis resort is really for people who want to do very little or do a lot of diving if you are not a diver its a perfect place to eat drink swim and lie in the sun on your own private beach sounds relaxing doesnt it,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

5.0,just returned from a  night stay with the wife and  small children after having lived and traveled around se asia for a number of years this is easily one of the best asian holidays weve had this corner of lombok is still very traditional and unspoilt pace of life is very slow one sees abundant rice padis maize fields water buffalos and horse drawn carts on the way to the resort the resort itself is relatively small and certainly has a very relaxed feel about it the cottages are tucked away in beautiful garden setting with some rooms facing the sea rooms have very high ceilings and are well appointed with both indoor and outdoor shower which the kids loved restaurant had a good variety of both western and asian food but the highlight for me was the extremely fresh seafood at tengirri tuna red snapper at very very fair prices not by any means a complaint however i still dont understand how a seared tuna steak costs the same as fried rice another huge highlight and the raison detre for the trip was the incredible snorkeling in the nearby lower gili islands the gili island closest the the resort is gili nanggu  minutes away by boat has great fish watching however the coral is largely destroyed i guess by the many boats that have anchored or plyed by there off to the edges of the island away from the boats and main beach the coral is much better the other  local gilis we went to gili rengit and gili layar had  intact and hugely impressive coral blooms both my  and  year old happily snorkelled there diving in direct from off the boat also very good pricequality ratio it seems somewhat better than what the same money will get you in krabi or phuket dont stay at this resort if you want nightlife andor shopping there is not much nearby and finally im scared to recommend this resort too highly as i dont want to spoil it for my next visit,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

4.0,stayed in cocotinos for  night room was nice and spacious also the bathroom was very nice and big the swimming pool is nice and on the beach the beach is also ok the place is located in a good area for island hopping food was normal nothing special but ok all staff very nice and available in case of need they helped us to reach next destination finding two motorbikes price of transportation boat rental etc are a litter over the average,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,this place is far from crowd everything you need is inside the hotel the view is excellent you can get sunrise and relax in the afternoon without being over exposed from the sunthe food is really good and also they have outdoor facilities like hopping island snorkling and diving the price is a little bit expensive but its worth with the facilities,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,i read about cocotinos on travelfishorg since i was on a  km cycling trip through the lesser sunda islands from time to time i granted myself a few days off in a comfortable hotel for a rest of all the lovely places i stayed in during my day trip cocotinos definitely ranks nr  its location is perfect on a beautiful beach facing a string of tropical islets far from urban centers its  km to lembar the ferry terminal  from mataram over  to senggigi the staff are helpful polite and very friendly i was certainly able to achieve my aims of resting and relaxing given the choice between senggigi and cocotinos youll have to decide if you prefer remote or crowds i chose remote and loved it,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,i came here for a weekend getaway while i was having business trip to mataram city i took a taxi that took about an hour to get here the atmosphere was really relaxing quite and peaceful far away from the crowd and all the staff were friendly the next morning i got up early to capture sunrise shot and it was such a sight for sore eyes i took a boat to gili nanggu which took only few minutes from cocotinos for snorkeling great experience i definitely recommend this hotel to all my friends,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
4.0,we spent  days at cocotinos the rooms and grounds are beautiful and the snokeling and diving was reasonably priced and a very comfortable boat however there is no where to really go outside of the resort we hired a bike and went for a ride to a surf beach which was much cleaner then the bay but the only place to eat is the resort and that can get a little boring so lovely place to stay but dont book for too long the beach also collects alot of rubbish from sengiggi but the hotle staff clean the beach every morning,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
4.0,the room is too old and dirty the lighting is too dark to my liking could not see things clearly when turning on all lights the bathroom floor is made by cement and tiny stones so the cement color goes into my feet or they never brush the floor coming out of the shower the feet became very black and the white cloth we wiped our feet became black too old towels rusty water pipe of the face basin i was so unhappy that i started to search for another hotelbut after i went to the their beach i decided to stick to the original plan of staying  nights the beach is so good sands are cream in color almost white sea water is so clean in other beaches i remember i feel sticky after sea bathing but here i feel very comfortable and didnt feel the need to wash with regular water we were the only guests there at the beach i just love that we walked to the nearest little island about  meters away water is just around my waist my husband walked the other route water did not wet his short pants saw some blue star fish and rarely seen other creatures just lovely it rained that late afternoon and the beach was very warm to swim the room service menu cost about  rp per dish foods taste good theres a hill near the resort on the other side of the street if we had stayed longer i would have tried to walk uptheres a table and  chairs in front of the room and a bamboo bench good to eat dinner and rest sitting there we can hear vehicles running on the street the small bed in the room looks so old and dirty the king bed is ok if this were a brand new room i would be happy to stay as the room is this old i will never return breakfast was a limited set not buffet we just left the beautiful living asia resort so this cocotinos feels so old and dirtythe pool is made from dark blue tiles the light blue tiles looks like shining stars and so photogenic but i did not want to swim in the pool feeling scared because of the dark blue color probably their beach is so great that i dont want to swim in the poolthe rate from agoda was  usd  booked directly with them which cost  usd  but they charged in rp and because of the poor exchange rate hotels everywhere does the same i regret i didnt book with agoda got a welcome fruit basket not sure if guests have it if booking with a booking company,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,came here  years ago and they still commit to and deliver great service from the meals service and dive facilities very glad i could come back for another wonderful staythe dive crew and the dive guides are top notch too,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,if you are seeking a really away from it all experience then this is the place delightfully positioned on its own quiet beach it was absolutely perfect no hassles no noise apart from the gentle lapping of the waves enjoy the massage on the health spa on the beach a pretty decent pina colado and a day in this beautiful spot should take away any stressthe staff were really wonderful the food was perfect nothing fake or glitzy here just warm hearted hospitality and great value rooms were very comfortable everything worked and was just right quick boat ride to the islands for snorkelling rounds off a perfect day,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
4.0,lovely place really lovely beach with beautiful shells and soft white sand snorkelling at nearby nanggu was excellent rooms were lovely and well looked afteri did find the price was not really reflective of the service it was very well run but the price was too high for what it wasstill recommend going there though for location and beauty,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,thank you so much for a lovely perfect break at this paradise so peaceful and staff were wonderful friendly and attentive and seemed to anticipate what i would require eg i was staying on my own and they knew i wanted to go snorkelling so they asked me if id like to join the dive boat saw two turtlescant praise the hotel enough thank you,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
4.0,this resort was a very pleasant surprise indeed if you want to get away from the crowds and see a part of lombok that is still free of tourists then you should consider cocotinosaccommodation was good with well spaced and decent sized bungalows set in very well maintained grounds sat tv and wifi available in room if required our room did have a minor leak when it rained hard however it was not an issue for usthe pool area is well designed and well maintained with the restaurant conveniently close the restaurant serves decent food with a mix of western and indonesian standards service is friendly and slowrelaxed definitely worth taking the free tour of the surrounding area to see mekaki beachplenty to see and do nearby unfortunately there was only a single bicycle which meant we could not go out as a family the area around the hotel is completely untouristed and this means that you will be eating all your meals in the hotel it also means that away from the hotel the beaches esp elaela beach can be a bit dirtyfull of rubbish which is a real pitythere is a scuba shop on premise however due to the poor visibility due to rain i was unable to use their services however i gather that there are some amazing dives in the region and we will be back to check it out it would also be worth bringing a road bike over if you are into your cycling as the main road is in great condition and has some great viewsoverall we enjoyed our break and will be back,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,we just spent  nights at this lovely little place if you want night life then do not come but if you want a relaxing place right on the beach with snorkeling on your doorstep then look no further the staff were all without exception friendly competent and with reasonable english the food is reasonably priced  not street vendor prices but a lot cheaper than melbourne breakfast and afternoon tea is included and the menu features asian and western dishes the highlight for us were the watersports there is a nice reef right there no more than  meters off the beach we organised a boat at their centre and had  dives whilst our partners snorkeled the dive master is very friendly experienced and with excellent english another day we hired the boat with  crew and island hopped we visited  small islands all within a few kms from the resort and snorkeled on  and at a great lunch ikan bakr on anotherwe traveled with another couple and rented the  story  br villa that has its own plunge pool rooms were spacious with ceiling fans and ac we could have stayed longer,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,lovely place that is off the beaten path dont come for the night life but instead for the snorkelling and diving and relaxation you can rent snorkel gear and swim out to the reef that is just a few meters offshore we also went for  dives one day which was fantastic the fellow that runs the dive shop is knowledgeable and friendly another day we rented a boat with crew and island hopped where we snorkelled and had some amazing ikan bakr grilled fish on a tiny little island within sight of the resortthe resort is a  min drive from the airport but they can arrange transport for you we had  nights booked but thanks to airasia were only able to stay for  but they were great the staff without exception are all friendly and with reasonable to good english skills far better than my indonesian food was good and reasonably priced  not cheap but certainly not melbourne prices we could have easily stayed longer and can see a return trip in our future,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,i had visited lombok a few times but never visited sekotongi booked into cocotinos for  nights and apart from scuba diving everyday i did not leave the resort all my meals were had in the restaurant and each meal was greatgreat food really friendly staff comforatable rooms and some of the best scuba diving at the various dive sites just a short boat ride from cocotinosi will definitely stay at cocotinos again,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,my husband and i have just spent a week in this delightful hotel last year we stayed in the busy tourist area of sengiggi in the north west of lombok and whilst taking a day trip round the island we discovered cocotinos sekotong which is situated on the southern peninsula of the island well away from the crowds we decided it was the sort of place we would prefer to stay in and we were right the hotel is a perfect little gem tucked away amidst a coconut grove and right on its own white sand beach there is a beautiful swimming pool set in a lovely setting right by the beach which was handy as it was too shallow to swim in the sea when the tide was out an open air restaurant small shop a spa and a water sports centre  the latter mainly dealing with trips to some of the numerous dive and snorkelling sites nearby as with the tourist areas in the north there are several gilis islands offshore but unlike those in the north which are packed with people these are virtually deserted they are small enough to walk round and a few have some basic restaurants but the snorkelling is good and the beaches are lovelythe rooms in the hotel vary from garden view ones to private villas with plunge pools situated right by the beach we had one of these rooms and it was great  huge comfortable bed with good bedlinen a massive stone bath indoor and outdoor showers twin wash basins outdoor daybed and sunloungers overlooking the beach and sea it was extremely clean and well maintained and had its own tea and coffee making facilities and a  litre drinking water tank the washing water in the hotel is slightly brackish hence they supply drinking water but that was no problem and there was loads of hot waterthe restaurant served a good selection of asian and western food we found the asian food to be better and a buffet breakfast which could be slightly more imaginative as far as breads and fruit juices are concernedif you are looking for an activity holiday with bright lights shopping nightlife etc then this hotel is definitely not for you there are no other hotels in the vicinity so this place is ideal for those wanting peace and quiet good diving and snorkelling relaxing massages in the spa and restful days there are also no annoying hawkers plying their trade on the beach  one of the most irritating things about staying in the tourist area up north in fact you hardly see anyone except the odd hotel guest on the beach incidentally i noticed that someone in a previous review said they couldnt walk anywhere  well we enjoyed several walks for miles along the beaches  it just required a bit of scrambling over rocks from time to timei would highly recommend this hotel all the staff were so friendly and willing to help that they made the stay very personal many of them speak little english but that was no problem and some especially in the restaurant are obviously fairly new to the hospitality business so things occasionally took a little longer to arrive but again with the laidback feeling to the place that wasnt a problem i would just like to make a couple of suggestions   it would be good if a jug of water or just a couple of glasses could be served on every table as a routine rather than have to ask for one at each meal  it would be a good idea to provide a bucket or container of water outside each room as a footbath to rinse the sand off your feet before going indoors we actually filled the big flowerpot that was by our plunge pool to use for that purposeincidentally we had to spend one night in bali on the way home due to flight times and although we stayed in a  star hotel one night was definitely enough  surly staff poor food and room in need of some maintenance attention  wished we were back in cocotinos,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
4.0,a very rustic feeling nice little resortnice little resort with excellent staff had a pleasant stay here its not luxury but it is comfortable nice big rooms lovely chill out areas and your own small beach also very good dive and watersports centreone thing though you are away from everything if you stay at this resort dont expect to go anywhere else as its not close to any other places of interest we stayed for  nights and for us was probably a bit too long i think  nights would have been perfect however others may enjoy the fact that you are away from it allfood wise was ok but again as you have nowhere really to go you are limited to the restaurant at the hotel menu would get a bit same after a whilei would however recommend going there again but more as a short break rather than staying for a week,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,we stayed at cocotinos hotel for  nights in early octoberthe location of the hotel is very secluded which works best if your goal is to have a quiet and relaxing holiday without much sightseeing or doing lots of shopping or night life activitiesthe hotel rooms are beautifully appointed villas some are facing the sea and others  the hill behind the rooms feel very comfortable and i liked the open air shower area i also liked that the staff or the hotel manager thought about little useful things like leaving mosquito coil for the outdoor sitting area at the veranda a rack for drying swimming attire etcthe dining area felt very airy and offered splendid sea views theres plenty of power points around to make charging of multiple gadgetsthe full board menu is always the same and the selection can become quite boring if you are staying there for a several days nevertheless some dishes were quite tasty and theres always ala cart menu for some variety on several days there were some liveaboard divers coming over for meals so i guess they liked the food toothe highlight for us was the diving we found the marine life very abundant and dive sites were relatively close at most  min boat ride away and diving conditions were easy it is mainly macro stuff that one sees on the dives so the place is great for photographers and whoever else finds small critters fascinating there were very few other divers and we sometimes found ourselves being the only two people on the dive because of that it was easy to ask the dive guide to bring us to the places we wanted to go to dive guides were familiar with the dive sites and very helpful and friendly the small boats were quite simple but functional and given that the dive sites are nearby are great for the taskin general we had very positive experience at cocotinos and would recommend it for both divers and nondivers who look for a slow and relaxing holiday,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
3.0,we stayed for our last few nights of a  week trip to indonesia thinking we would splurge at the end the rooms were nice grounds were pretty and restaurant staff were friendly tea and snacks at  was a nice touch snorkelling off the pierbut the beach is very small and isolated could not walk anywhere else to eat coffe tea and juice were double the price of anywhere else there were only  lounge chairs and they were very uncomfortable most irritating was how they ripped us off for transport to the airport they charged us double what they should have then offered to stop enroute to visit two places but were going to charge us another  each for this when i said no they tried to bargain i did not expect this of a nice hotelwould not stay here again,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,this place was a great find lovely villas  simply but tastefully furnished we had a family one right on the beach you can snorkel from the beach and see huge corals around the jetty the beach is small but clean we had a boat trip out to visit nearby islands for a day the staff were very friendly and we enjoyed plenty of snorkelling again seeing loads of coral although some bleached and turtles there are a couple of kayaks which are nice to use at sunset to spot the turtles from the food was good  the indonesian options better than the western as could be expected thoroughly enjoyed our stay,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,it was a pleasant experience from bookings to the stay itself rahman from sales replied my email  messages fast he even help to arrange a birthday surprise for my friend we stayed in garden view double room room is big  comfortable water from tap taste salty but they had a big jar of fresh water in the toilet that helps as i use it for a final rinse during shower and also for rinsing my underwater casing for the camera drinking water was provided in a l container which is a great idea we took the full board package with dives the portion is big after a few meals in the restaurant i do get a bit bored with the menu i like the dessert  especially the pisang goreng even though on the nd day of our dives  of us are the only divers but they still sent out  guides   boat crews that was great it would have been a perfect holiday for us shall the weather is betterit is wet season now ,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,loved  the beach here is awesome clear water white sand and not a lot of people when we were there we almost had the whole beach to ourselves really appreciated the peace and quietcan be improved  the food is good but can be a bit better since we heard that the owner is an expat overall still ok maybe we are just picky with our food,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

3.0,i stayed at this secluded hotel for  nights the room we took was excellent clean and the staff were very friendly however there were a few things that we wish would have been better first off the water taps mostly treated salt water and it was a shock to the system when you brush your teeth before bed or while showeringfood at the restaurant was edible at best especially the local food which was mostly horrible we tried most of the dishes on the menu and we would recommend eating the western food its marginally betterthe beach and view of the ocean was a delight but we found ourselves wondering why none of the other guests were frolicking until we stepped food onto the beach and quickly realised the beach was full of dead corals it was a tad disappointingthe pool was a nice size and warm which was very nice and transport to and from the airport was quick and efficientall in all i would come back to stay here again but hopefully they have a new chef in the kitchen,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

4.0,we had a toddler with us during our stay of  nights the resort is child friendly it was a very relaxing holiday very private location and serene staff were helpful and obliging the dive centre is well equipped with some good macro diving and knowledgeable team during our stay i happened to be the only guest diving save for the st day where another couple were present on the nd day being the only guest i had to pay a surcharge for the boat this was communicated during registrationas the location is quite secluded all meals are within the hotel compound which was quite acceptable for us as the ala carte menu had some good selections to satisfy western and asian palates since its almost  hours drive from the airport it is recommended to arrange for transport by the hotel the driver was very careful during the drive and punctualoverall the experience was very good and we will return to the resort when we visit lombok again,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,located in remote area in southwest of lombok this boutique hotel is great to relax and escape a good professional and professional dive center is located in the hotel ensure to organize a diving or snorkeling trip during your stay for all meals you will have to stay in the hotel as there is about nothing in the surrounding i would have expect more fresh fish from fisher man of the surrounding villages food display could have been better,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
3.0,we were  friends that want to spent a relaxing and amazing time at the end of our travel around indonesia we decided to stay in cocotinos for  nights and we found not easy to book  rooms from the hotel website the system only leaves you to book one room at the same time so we were not sure if we did it thought the website if we will be able to find another free room it should be easier for guests to book as many rooms as they want at least  or  rooms and not need to call  times to the hotel to be sure the reservation is donewhen we arrived to cocotinos we thought the place was the paradise the location is great and the beautiful views you see from the reception desk makes you think you will enjoy so much your time there the rooms are really beautiful cleaned with the details which you expect to find in a hotel of this category but while our stay we are getting disappointed with the service of the hotel for all of us was amazing and relaxing time because you were in a nice place but we really think that could have been an unforgivable time and a unique experience for all of usthe staff seems to be there like spending their time they do not come to the pool and offer you a fruit juice for example or trying to make you easy to have a diving daytrip etc the kind of plates you can eat in the restaurant are not the expected in a boutique resort and some of them are empty like the tuna steak which finally at the rd day we had the opportunity to tastei manage a hotel too and all the time i had the sensation that the big problem of this hotel is the management and the nomotivation and notraining of their staff if i were the owner of this hotel i will try to find a professional manager who would run this amazing paradise resort and try to do his best to make the stay of their guests the unique experience that i think people expected to have when decide to go to a place like this,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
3.0,this hotel is well locatedthough not a lot of facilities nearbyand alright a few quiet days the rooms are very nicebut this place is overpriced food quality very ordinary and cooked breakfast buffet not kept warm the place has good potential if better managedstaff very friendlybut lack proper training would have to do a lot better to deserve its rating,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
3.0,we booked  nights in this hotel and while the isolation wasnt a problem for us the standards of the rooms food and service were as previous reviewers have mentioned the staff are all very nice and well intentioned but need some basic training lost reservations room service and lunch plates sitting around for hours after wed eaten and food standards that would be ok in a hotel about one third of this price were some of the annoyances we encountered it is a very beautiful location and a great place to stay if you plan to go out on lots of diving and boat trips as theyve got their own jetty and dive centre,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,we stayed there celebrating our anniversary and they gave us complimentary spa massage which was the best massage weve ever encounter and we are spa addict couplethe room is comfortable spacious have  area to shower indoor and semi outdoor it was facing both the pool and beach there were only  rooms that occupied during the time us and the other couple so it was pretty quiet maybe because the resort is not nearby the main attraction in lombok it was almost  hours dricing from senggigibreakfast was ala carte so they cook it after you order more personalized and fresher aside from free spa and breakfast room package was also including afternoon teawe were so pleased that we chose to stay at this resort we even recomend some of our friends to stay there and they share mutual satisfaction,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
4.0,the resort is located in an amazing setting if you are looking for a totally relaxing break this is the place for you we were fortunate to be upgraded to a water front villa with its own plunge pool it is one of the best rooms we have stayed in in all our travelsthe staff could not be faulted all very helpful and attentivethe only criticism is the breakfast is very basic and nothing is kept warm so if you prefer hot dishes i suggest going to breakfast earlyhighly recommend this resort to anyone looking for a total getawaywe caught a taxi from the airport which cost us about au and the trip took about  hours due to all the roadwork,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
4.0,we loved the drive from the airport to cocotinos which took us through some really interesting parts of the island allowing us to see the local people going about their daily lives mostly untouched by tourism the resort is set in an ideal location with amazing views its a little bigger than most we stayed at and as such the facilities seemed a little stretched not quite enough sunloungers or room around the pool having said that it did not distract from our enjoyment but probably impacts on our feeling of valueformoney we took the boat out to the island for snorkelling and the staff were friendly and informative the rooms were set in lovely gardens but lacked privacy in terms of noise some rooms are interconnecting and you can hear everything next door our neighbors had a toddler who thankfully slept silently but that could have been an issue our room was not serviced during the  nights we stayed which we understand was an oversight rather than the norm and again didnt bother us but with the price of the rooms you might expect more attentive service however we had a lovely stay and it was great to be away from the main tourist areas in such a beautiful setting,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
4.0,me and my boyfriend spent in this resort a couple of days during our tour in indonesia the location is very nice far from anything so any guest should be aware of the choice to spend a very quiet and relaxing vacation the travel from the airport is quite long and the status of the street is not the best accomodations are nice cleaness can be improved but still decent the bathroom is huge and has a wonderfull outdoor shower the hotel offers  lt water available daily in the room breakfast is ok dinner choice a la carte is very good much better then buffet one generally the structure of the resort is really pleasant most of the rooms offer sea view they are all very close to beach restaurant and swimming pool we visited also the gili islands around but both for snorkling and diving they are less interesting than gili trawangan area recommended,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
4.0,my husband and i stay here in august  we found the staff helpful and our room was very pleasant a very laid back life style and prefect for relaxing it was great to find out that most of the staff were from the surrounding villages which help their families and their local communities having said that their english is mostly fine but some things did get lost in translation at times and they are learning as they work and service may not be what we may expect because of the remote location most things food massages tourist items were more expensive loved the outdoor shower in our room,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
1.0,i booked a room for my family stay during the ramadhan holiday from the th of july until nd of august through our corporate travel agent the reason why we picked this place is because its secluded area private beach and it has its own pier we wanted to stay undisturbed and away from the hustle and bustle of the city or other tourist destination areas also we would like to sail on our boat during the last days of our holiday changed of plans the kids wanted to sail earlier so we had our boat pick us up on the st my husband came to the reception in the morning to pay our meals and informed them that we are going sailing and our family friend is coming to occupy the room for the remaining two days that we already paid for they said no problemwe left from the pier telling the staff how wonderful our stay was and thank them for their hospitality we liked our bedroom our meals and the beach was beautifullater in the evening i received message from our friend that says him and his family cant check in because the travel agent hasnt paid for our bedroom so they charged him for the remaining two nights how does that makes any sense then i had our assistant called and try to resolve whatever problem they were havingthe next day our assistant said there were miscommunication inside the management and mr rahman the marketing told her that my friend wont be charged for the room since we paid for it but on the check out day they still got charged the manager who refused to give us his name or talk to any of us he had the reception to talk to us does not agree that my friend stayed without paying he tried to feed us lies saying that my husband checked out before tour time and we got an early check out fee he said that cocotinos will refund my friends money after the payment has been cleared from the agent which i just got informed few moments ago is on process and will take approximately two weeksi mean seriously my family and i are lucky enough to be able to stay in resorts around the world and this is by far the most disappointing and shameless we paid the travel agent already and its not our problem if they havent paid the hotel we are staying at and if that was the true reason why when we checked in we didnt have the problemi talked to the travel agent personally and they admit they havent paid based on personal work agreement with the hotel which the customer has nothing to do with i talked to the reception and the marketing manager and the reservation asking about the hotel policy and they assured us that we shouldnt encounter problem like this in the first placeour conclusion is the manager tried to rip off customer because it is high seasonwe told our friends family work partners and they all astonished of what happened our corporate agent is reluctant to work with this place after what happened we have been using them for family travel or work travel all over the world and never had a single problemat the end of the day what makes an accommodation live up to their names is their service thats why we called it accommodation to accommodate to cater and by all means this so called resort has failed to do their purpose what this place did was unacceptable and i would never recommend it to anybody which is a shame because the place itself has potential,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
4.0,after a long drive from kuta coconitos was a welcomed short stopover on our way to mount rinjaniour rooms were beautiful and clean the beach and pool equally beautiful having stayed in five different lombok hotels so far cocotinos was the only one to charge a high season surcharge it is also very isolated and so has a captive audience when it comes to dining,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

4.0,we were very happy to discover this place randomly on internet the place is beautifulnice villa attentive staffs and wonderful view of west lombok oceanit was not too crowded it was rather quiet which is goodwe extended our stay so that we could enjoy more of this place and its surroundingsfood was ok not impressive because the place is far from the main city hence rather difficult to have sufficient ingredients for good food or drinksoverall this place is recommended for you who dives and seeks for a notpartying mood ,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,damn i went there for dn for my leisure diving trip fudge when i reached the airport there were already people fetching us and helping us carry our luggage and the customer service doesnt stop right there mother fudge packers at hot towel greeting us when we reached the resort bend me over man while i was smoking and settling some insurance stuffs fruit cakes they gave me fudge packing juice and a ash tray dude i tell you man i dont know what the hell i can do to improve the place the only flaw was that most staffs werent fluent in english but its alright money talks recommended for honeymoons and stuff but not for diving a little to expensive,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,just got back from honeymoon trip to lombok my husband and i stayed at this resort to be honest we didnt put high expectation to this resort since we booked the package from our travel agent in a very last minute before our trip and you know how online photos are sometimes different with the reality so yeah we really didnt expect much but we did book a full board package includes meals and return transport from and to airport we didnt regret this since the resort is very secluded the resorts driver mr ramli picked us up in the airport and it took us approximately  hours from the praya airport and  hours to mataram city once we arrived we fell in love straight away with this place small front office but with a very great hospitality from the staff beautiful scenery of sekotong beach with white sandy beach and blue water and oh not to mention the beach chairs our room was  with king size bed a spacious bathroom and a balebale next to our window nice also they included a liter drinking water since the water here is brackish aaannnddd an electric mosquito repellant genius guys thank you our full board package for dn includes  lunch  dinners breakfast massage voucher and trip to gili nanggu i have no complaint about the food but may be because im not too picky about food the breakfast was served in ala carte style of either american eastern indonesian or continental and a buffet of juices coffeetea and fresh fruits we went to gili nanggu for snorkeling the next day with a small speed boat provided by the resort we also tried the spa in the afternoon i decided to have a mnts back and foot massage while my husband tried mnts foot massage only and how was it it was so gooooddd both of us agreed that the lady masseurs in this resort spa are the best in short we had a really great time here in this resort the staffs hello pak komang and pak heru are very helpful we are local tourist we often feel treated like second class tourist in a resort like this just because we are not bule foreigners but we didnt experience this at all the staffs are very nice and friendly overall i really recommend this resort if you are looking for a place to relax away from all the hustle bustle this is the place,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,first off  sorry everyone at cocotinos for writing this review so late from our arrival in lombok we were treated to some of the best hospitality that ive experienced anywhere the team  cocotinos are all friendly accommodating and warm even when we made requests they were quick to come up with solutions and deliverthe property itself is very unassuming and its only when you take the time to explore that you appreciate how much thought and care goes into the making of this gem of a resort the grounds are well kept and some of the flowers are beautiful everything is kept very clean and they even have the beach cleaned every daythe rooms are comfortable and well appointed special note here they process their own water for use in the bathrooms so the water is very clean and a little salty but we really didnt spend much time in our room given that we had fantastic weather and some of the best snorkelling to be had only a short boat ride away another thank you to the team  the dive shop for taking such good care of us while we were therewe also spent quite a few evenings at the small but very good spa the therapists were very good and our first visit was enough to convince us to go back every eveningfinally but by no means the least important is the food we were blown away by the quality of the food that is served at the coffee house the waiters and waitresses are all super and special kudos must be given to the chef  we are dying to come back for more of your mee goreng and rendangall in all  a most satisfying trip that was made all the more special by the fantastic team at the cocotinos sekotongthank you all and we hope to see you again in the near future ,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
4.0,stayed for three nights in a beach front room with plunge pool as part of our honeymoon in lombok mid june the resort is close to a road but no big deal there are no shops or anything really apart from small villages close by its at least  hour to the nearest port and hrs from the airport you are a captured audience for breakfast lunch and dinner but we had done our research so was not a problem and didnt expect to be venturing out to eat the room was great pool area great staff friendly if a little undertrained even by lombok standards we had stayed in mangsit near sengigi  quinci villas before cocotinos so had had  days of the best service and food and resort available but this wont tarnish my review of cocotinos if you like swimming photography fishing from the pier i caught several barracuda kg and various opportunities for other fishing if you bring your own gear we hired a fishing boat from neighbouring resort and went out to banko banko furthest point south west from the resort  hour trip amazing scenery etc then this is a good place to chill out in the south of lombokthere was one big disappointment at cocotinos the food we like eating local food on our travels and expect local seafood when on the coastal areas i appreciate the resort is remote and they have to cater for mixed nationalities but the foodmenu needs some serious attention the menu is too big offering burgers pasta lots of eu recipes with a small amount of indonesian options the dont have fresh seafood on the menu as i was told all is frozen i even tried to preorder from the market but they were unable to source its a real shame the food is a big let down my suggestion would be to retrain the chefs half the menu and focus on better quality ingredients and do some bbqs in the evening to keep the guests entertained my only other gripe is that a small bintang from the minibar is kidr  which is way over the top compared to other hotels and a large bintang from the bar is also overpriced wine was also  more than more upmarket places in lombok you can bring your own wine which we did and they will charge you kidr corkage which is fairive been honest about the poor quality of food and overkill on the menu as we really enjoyed our time here but would only come back if these issues got resolved it would be great to see a small fresh looking menu that changes and based on local fish from the local boats that deliver this must be the easiest option as i saw many locals catching fish and am sure a deal could be done to deliver every other day direct to the hotel,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,nice quite location with well maintained grounds and poolour accomadation was luxurious and spotlessthe staff and management went out of their way to ensure we had a good staythe snorkelling at the nearby islands was amazing its definitely a must as they have the most beautiful coral and tropical fish in clear calm warm waterswe enjoyed the cocktails and meals at the restauranti will be returningthanks to all staff for making our stay memorable we were sad to leave,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

5.0,my daughter and i came here on a whim wanting somewhere to chill out after the tourists in gili trawangan what a great choice beautifully kept grounds and rooms a private beach relaxed but attentive service and above all delightful staff the snorkelling is also brilliant  much better than at the gilis in my opinion  and according to my daughter the diving is good too especially if youre into the smaller species the food is good too although if youre vegetarian like me the choice is a little limited but if youre not  all in all had a great timeanna l,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

5.0,stayed here over the easter break  took a relaxation package in a wart edge villa fantastic service from check in to checkout staff were very attentive and professional all aspects of our package were organised and confirmed room was very nice size and comfortable  restaurant was good typical mix of local and western foodthe place is quite isolated so unless your going to relax and enjoy the beach a massage some snorkelling and chilling out choose another location but it is very peaceful and nice,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
4.0,we thoroughly enjoyed our recent stay in cocotinos after two weeks we left completely relaxed as it was offseason the resort was rather quiet most of the stay which suited us fine we had a waterfront villa with plunge pool and lovely view the villa which is tastefully decorated comfortably accommodated the five of usthe staff took great care of us we enjoyed evening walks in the hills with staff members the children had private cooking lessons we often rented the kayak which the children could safely use in the cove snorkeling off the jetty and at beach front was really great  better even than at some of the gillis  we spotted at least  variety of starfish just in the beachjetty area we enjoyed spa treatments to the sounds of the breeze and the ocean my husband and i had a romantic dinner for two on the beach the kitchen staff offered us items not on the menu all in all it was one of the most relaxing holidays weve hadwhat appealed to us was that cocotinos is set far away from busier parts of the island but be aware of that if youre the type looking for more action there is no gym so during a longer stay you have to get creative to get some exercise aside of course from endless hours of swimming i jogged through the kampongs and felt safe the kids appreciated the evening walks with madi to stretch their legswadi is an excellent driver  far better than any taxi driver here in singapore he brought us around on a day tour and a couple of visits to local villages great visit to  local schools skip the monkey forest  its the same monkeys we have here in sgthe rubbish in the water distracts from the snorkeling experience but this is not the fault of cocotinos unfortunately garbage disposal in this part of the world is not yet the priority it is elsewherea tip for housekeeping clean bed linens during our  week stay would have been appreciated but aside from that our room was clean and comfortableheru does an excellent job in managing he wasnt around the first couple of days when we arrived but after he arrived we noticed a different level of activity of the staff and more personal attention keep up the good work heru you have a wonderful opportunity with a job like yours thank you and your team for creating this paradise and thank you to the general manager whos name escapes me a kind gentleman whom i enjoyed speaking withkind regards to the teamnoelle fred lucas emily and sarah,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

3.0,i booked the cocotinos because of a friends recommendation and when i came to the small resort it really looked nice the rooms are nice and clean and the place is pretty and well laid out the central pool is nice and resort well kept the location is stunning so why only  stars well the food is dull at best and priced like a star restaurant now that wouldnt have been so bad if there had been any alternatives nearby but in a place where theres nothing to do other than swimming diving dining and whatever fun that one can have on the room theres no dvd either those things have to be great now the diving swimming and snorkelling in sekotong is worldclass but cocotinos can hardly take the credit for that theres simply no excuse for the uninspired stuff we had for every meal  and learn to brew a decent coffee guys i hope the ownermanager reads this review i would love to come back here  its a great place in a fabulous that has a lot of promise now its time to deliver on that promise,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

5.0,everything about this hotel was perfect the staff the views the room all had us feeling completely comfortable and relaxed instantly this place really caters to those who just need a break from the daily grind it is very isolated so if you want to be close to nightlife etc then sekotong is definitely not for you  but its isolation means you can find yourself completely alone on a beautiful stretch of coast  i know what i would choose trips to the surrounding islands for exploring snorkeling and diving are easily arranged and at this time of year you might be diving with a couple of divemasters to yourself the staff lead by the magic heru made our stay extra special we expected the lack of food options to be a problem but once we commented on our love of spicy food the staff were keen to prepare local food for us  i hope heru keeps trying out new ideas for the restaurant to keep the kitchen and customers excited we will definitely be back,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,if you want to get away from life for a few days and rest and relax this is the spot for youwe spent  days and came back home feeling completely refreshed and rejuvenated the setting is fabulous for those wanting to get away from it all  the only local small shops are a  km or so walk away and there is pretty much nothing to buy  so if you want to shop you will need to go to sengigi or bali this place is for chillaxingthe pool is clean and perfectly located this is the first time i have ever hung around the pool on deck chairs with a drink playing cards and scrabble and being pampered  not the last now eitherthe breakfast is delicious and generous and there is an afternoon teahigh tea as well as there isnt anywhere else to eat the restaurant is your only option  the food is good and the staff open to ideas  we like our food hot and this wasnt a problem we didnt try the western food but those with us said it was fine we suggested that we would have liked more local food options  so on our last night the manager hero sorted us an amazing local meal  what a lovely surprise that was as mangoes my favourite fruit was in season he also got me a big bag of delicious mangoes during the stay and the restaurant staff were always happy to cut me up some more at breakfast time when we were ill the manager even went out of his way to organise medicine from the apothekthere is a dive shop and boat trips to the closeby gilis are a good option we also hired a car through the hotel and went on a day trip to kuta we ascertained that we had made the right decision to stay at cocotinos as it met all our needs other options included boat trips for diving and snorkeling and fishing a walk up the hill behind and trip to the local village etcoh and a free  min massage at the local spa with a view of the ocean from the outdoor massage beds agung the masseuse provides a great relaxing massage too the beach is perfect  lots of shells to collect crabs to watch etcthere is a fair bit of seaweed in the ocean but you can swim over it and there are lots of fish to see just off the jetty we saw a school of angelfish in the same spot for  hoursthe rooms were perfect  who wouldnt want an outside shower the bed is huge and so comfortable and the staff happy to help by providing whatever we needed there is a bar fridge some snacks in the room would also be a good idea and robes and all that stufflots of little touches that really make it extra comfortable take your own coffee if you want a decent coffee before breakfast  its fine if you are ok with nescafe and indocoffee mix or tea with powdered milk the local coffee at breakfast is delicious howeveroverall if you want to get away from it all this is the place staff make the place and they get a  especially hero the manager  we will definitely go back and stay in a double room with a private pool and i will even take my highly allergic son with me as i trust that hero will work with me to ensure the food is safe for himterimah kasih hero pak teddi agung opie jo imam and all the others whose names i cant remember  we hope to see you again soon,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,we have just returned from a long weekend at cocotinos and were very impressed with the resort the staff service room and all aspects of the resort were more than we expected from accommodation in a fairly remote location the rooms were very neat and clean staff were friendly and helpful restaurant was good and the resort beach and house reef were great too the resort dive centre was excellent very professional and well organised its a great get away location and well worth the trip to get there,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,the setting is perfect so relaxing and romantic the view is just breathtaking the staff were very friendly and obliging the food is excellect i would recommend this place to anyone who just wants to relax and chill out,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
3.0,we booked our stay here after a very enjoyable stay at their sister resort in manado and almost everything was just as good except the foodwe booked a pool villa by the beach which was fantastic and worth the extra money since the beach was not ideal for swimming the only downside was if people decided to use the lounge chairs right outside the villa so there was no privacy as they could look straight onto your pool and into the roomunfortunately we were a little disappointed with the food  it was hit and miss  some dishes like the seafood were good when others were not the western food was surprising better than the local cuisine which was lacking flavour and spice perhaps it was diluted for tourists and despite asking for extra heat the local dishes like the curry noodles and others were still bland since it is a la carte and with only one restaurant it is important to have consistently good foodif they improved the quality of the food we would consider returning if we visiting lombok again but we would be definitely returning to their sister resort in manado,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,cocotinos sekotong is perfect for people who are looking for quiet serenity the resort is rather small but the view from the pool deck and restaurant is simply breathtaking  white sandy beach turquoise waters the three tiny islands and silhouette of mountains looming in the background the staff was very friendly and attentive other than a snorkeling trip that can be booked through the resort cocotinos also offered freeofcharge drive through neighboring villages and guided short hike to a small hill behind the resort for sunset viewing the food is good the pools water is always warm and inviting at any time of the day and we really enjoy the quiet relaxation the resort offers my partner and i stayed in the smallest room the garden room yet it comes with indoor and outdoor showers a day bed by the window a very comfortable bed and tall ceiling for extra airiness we love our stay here one suggestion for cocotinos your resort is definitely better than the official pictures you post here so an update of better quality photos will do cocotinos more justice,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,it was well worth the drive we arrived for two nights from the upper gilli island our transport did not work out so we ended up with a driver who was non english speaking this was interesting it was a  hour drive and we had to stop for directions at least  times but what an amazing place the staff was great the on site scuba was top notch we had an amazing snorkel trip the turtlesfish coral and sponges were something we have never seen we had just been on an over crowded trip on the upper gillis what a difference wish we had skipped the upper gilli islands,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,as usual we booked this pretty last minute as my wife wants to see hammerheads this time round so we only booked it one week earlier the only thing we did right was to speak to martinus  gmdirector of cocotinos manado as we are regulars divers with odyssea divers and had stay with martinus we got a good rate with him so it pays to be regulars and using one brand membership has its privilegesnow our other problem was due to the last minute we could not use our redemption miles on economy class so we ended on using more miles on business class not that i am complaining but business class on mi silkair is different from sq singapore airlines as the services just isnt there in fact throughout the flight we had economy class passengers walking up and down the aisle using the toilets as we are frequent flyers we do not even dare use the business class toilet but i guess it just boils down to the flight attendants so thumbs down for miback to cocotinos sekotong we were greeted at the airport by a pleasant airport rep and driver and was driven to the resort which is minutes away as we arrived on mi in the night we didnt see much of the sceneryas a regular to its sister resort in manado we were greeted like regulars to this resort and ushered to our room we booked a terrace room but was upgraded to a garden room which had an outdoor shower and the room is much bigger we totally enjoyed the upgrade the room is spacious and very nice it is similar in style to its sister in manado in fact the whole layout is same as mando from the reception to restaurant to room only different is  location which is great as the dive sites are all nearby  food is really very good as compare to its sister we love the food here we were wondering if we can request for the lombok chef to be at manado when we visit them next year  sleep was good as we didnt have the villagers next to us but there is a road and is quiet most of the them  a beach which we can hang out and snorkel too  dive centre operations is similar to its sister but different as zainal runs the operations differently and efficiently we were happy to have mamang as our dive guide and as i am a photographer with his keen eyes he spotted a lot of creatures for us by the way his master is james from its sister property in manado another good spotter of creatures in fact mamang was given a subject list of creatures that i will be shooting this time and there were only two that we didnt find  leaf fish and a pink frog fishas we traveled in october we plan to dive at belongas to see the hammerheads and had booked for a one day dive there it is consider offseason we changed our minds and stay through for our  dives daynights of diving with zainal and his team on our first two days of diving it was virtually private diving but on the third day we had another two couples with us for diving as we were using nitrox we did our own diving with mamang as it was simply wonderful for usso if you plan to stay in lombok  stay with lombok boutique resort  cocotinos sekotong where you find good food wonderful accommodation great hospitality and for divers an excellent diving experience,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,i have been to many resorts in asia and many are nice but cocotinos is special the room rate is also very reasonable for the type of room and level of luxury offered i am not much of a beach person but i really enjoyed the boat trips to the lovely island and the snorkeling was great this place feels special because the staff are so friendly and will go out of their way to meet your requests here you do not have the usual  pools and heaps of food during breakfast like in a big resort in bali but there is enough variety every morning and there is the plus point that you are not having breakfast with  other people every morning here the staff remember your name with only little english they try their bestthe hours spent on the patio reading relaxing and overlooking the sea was the best part of my trip the food was tasty without being fancy grilled fish is best the setting up of the daily complimentary afternoon tea at pool side remind me to go for a break after a few hours reading beach is clean most days but occasionally heaps of corals being washed up and you would have to walk with a good pair of beach slippersi took a trip south with others and saw two or three wonderful rugged beaches lombok is great if you like what nature has to offer cocotinos is quiet and feels like a part of nature great place to get away from stress and simply relax if you like busybusy place go elsewhere,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

5.0,i decide to do a bali lombok combination trip this year for bali i stayed in ubud for the cool and the craft and art for lombok i came back to cocotinos sekotong my second trip here and wow what a beautiful experience again i stayed in a garden room again it was just as comfortable as before and suits my budget not so expensive for the quality and luxury much better than my hotel in ubudthe fried banana dessert was just as good as before the complimentary afternoon tea was really great there is also wifi now in the whole lobby and it is free i was told they have a new provider i did some work on my covered patio outside my room and the wifi was good and stableon the last morning i did my sun salute at the end of the jetty i was almost overwhelmed with tears knowing i had to leave thank you cocotinos for another wonderful stay,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,it was my very first trip to lombok with friends and i am glad i choose cocotinos i took my friends advice and chose a quite place for a break after the haze in kl the fresh air in the resort was simply great my first impression of the resort was that it was so clean and well kept the swimming pool was crystal clear i could see the stone tile at the bottom of the deep end which could not be said of many resorts i have been to my room was spotless and the flowers on my bed made me feel very welcome the amount of food for breakfast was more than enough and the spread was quite good with lots of fruits including local mangoes and star fruit not just the usual boring pineapple and watermelon you get in most hotels around here the homemade jam and bread were also yummyfor me the best thing about cocotinos was that there were no lifesize mysterious statues everywhere like those you can find in many bali resorts the place felt spiritually bright without the feeling of eyes staring at me whereever i went especially at night i felt completely relaxed and undisturbed in the beautiful flower garden beneath tall coconut trees strolling on the beach or simply resting in my room it was incredible to shower outside with bananas hanging flowers around me and coconut trees above  total freedom and privacy the staffs were warm and friendly they remembered my name i went to the spa twice and would have gone more but it was quite packed and they had only two therapists the sofa bed in the room and the covered patio were great for reading or taking a napnow for a few minor complaints   the resort has a number of ugly land crabs and one night i got a fright outside my room when a big one crossed my path and scrabbled up a coconut tree being a city girl i never imagined it was possible for crabs to climb up trees so quickly and the geckos were also noisy but lucky for me i soon got used to their sharp cries the staff told me the gecko is a special animal like a mascot for lombok i could hear them but i could not see one they were so well camouflaged some days a fair bit of rubbish do wash up on the beach but the gardeners did a great job sweeping it up every morning so the beach was always clean during the day the beach has broken corals though which is a bit hard on the bare feet so it is advisable to wear beach sandals i found the food portions a bit too big for me but i suppose it suited others who had huge appetites i would have preferred smaller portions with more tasty bits on the side and i had to ask for more chili dips always with the complimentary crisps during dinner hey some of us can eat hot food but to be fair the staff always tried their best and on the last night i got more than my share of different types of fiery dipsi went on a tour of the countryside and got some nice pottery at banyumulek  recommended the rice fields were green and soothing to the eyes if you like quiet and nature come to cocotinos i really enjoyed my relaxing holiday in lombok terima kasih to all the staff at the resortbagus this is one place i will consider returning to for sure whenever i get tired of shopping and eating in big cities,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,cocotinos sekotong is off the beaten  way off that only makes it more charming  but expect little besides relaxing snorkeling and diving the rooms are large and very comfortable in the middle of a lovely garden staff is very friendly and helpful and the hotel prides itself on recruiting locally nice food although catering to an international crowd the hotel could usefully introduce local tastes to its menu the pool and beach are private and peaceful finally the hotel has its own diving centre offering the possibility of visiting the south gilli islands worth visiting for some amazing snorkeling or diving thanks cocotinos,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
2.0,our family of  stayed for  nights at cocotinos sekotong in june  overall we would say that the hotel is well designed and the staff do try to provide good service the place is fairly quiet and very accessible if you are looking to visit the southern gili islands nanggu gede rengit they even have a private jetty that make boarding and unboarding from the boats much more convenient the beach is a great place to walk in the late afternoon during the low tide as you can find all kinds of sea creatures in the shallow water the only real problem we have is the lack of attention to cleanliness in our rooms and also in the spa treatment we took a massage and scrub at the spa whilst the massage was good the therapist did not bother to wash our feet or cover our hair so she struggled with pulling away our hair each time it got in the way of the massage neither did she bother to ask if the massage pressure was suitable or if she should turn down the aircon in case we felt cold without our clothes after applying the scrub we struggled to the shower room with bits of scrub falling all over the floor to take a shower we stayed at the rinjani suite and for the first two nights there were mozzies and we had to put down the mosquito net the cabinet and sink in the bathroom were dusty and so was the bed see photos attached we were told that the resort was fairly new  less than  years old but it sure didnt seem like it the final straw came on our final night at the hotel my husband was woken up in the middle of the night by a large rat a little less than cm that was scurrying around on our bed and accidentally bumped his face and we did not bring any food to our bedroom at all except for bottles of mineral water we reported this to the staff at checkout the next morning but they seemed pretty nonchalant about it not sure if this was because they couldnt understand english that well or didnt find it surprising to be woken up by a rat the counter staff was not at all apologetic for the disturbance we also spoke with the owner who happened to be there and he said he had not encountered such rat incident before overall a good location for water activities but unless the level of cleanliness improves we wont be going back anytime soon the room rates are not cheap so we would have expected much better quality than what we got,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,cocotinos is a small hotel in a great peaceful and scenic location from the moment we arrived until the moment we left we had a thoroughly relaxing and enjoyable stayour room was spacious and spotlessly clean as was the bathroom and the showerwe enjoyed the swimming pool and the beach and our excursions to neighbouring villages and beacheseveryone at cocotinos was friendly courteous and helpful and made our stay very enjoyable,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,i visited cocotinos a few years agothis year we went to revisit malaysia and baliwe stayed in some high profile resorts in bali what a mistake that we didnt visit again cocotinosthe resort is the perfect place to relax with great service pool villas views very well run hoteli am still angry with myself that we didnt come to cocotinos again and instead we wasted some time staying in bali in ugly big hotelskeep doing great job cocotinos ,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
4.0,if youre looking for a quieter alternative to the rigors and crowds of bali this hotel on lombok is an excellent choice dont expect wild nightlife and endless shopping but do expect a small friendly comfortable hotel in a lovely beach setting with a beautiful swimming pool the rooms are well appointed and roomy the restaurant has enough variety and quality to keep you interested and the day excursions for snorkeling and exploring to nearby gili nanggu give you plenty to do car hire and day trips around lombok can also be arranged and the resort has its own dive centre and dive trips check if theyre expecting a group from a cruise ship to drop in for a swim as you might want to make that the day you go on an excursion while the group may only be there for a few hours it did feel like an invasion and it would have been good to know in advance it will take you hrs to get there from the airport i suggest you arrange transport with the hotel even though its a little more expensive as the drivers know exactly where theyre going and the journey will be much quicker the cost of hiring a car and driver for excursions from the hotel is expensive compared to bali but then its so nice to be there you wont want to do too much of that oh and dont forget to indulge in a treatment at the spa perched above the beach in the gentle breeze,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

4.0,my wife and i decided to stay  nights at cocotinos in lombok as we have been to bali a few times  we thought wed give lombok a shotwe were picked up from the airport as i had arranged a return transfer through the hotel  the drive was about  mins and we also stopped at a convenience store along the way as noted in the homepage of cocotinos the resort is rather isolated which for us was fine but it may not suit those looking for some actioncheckin was smooth and staff most friendly our room was number  which is the waters edge villa the room itself was very comfy with a small plunge pool and decent sized verandah with day bed and  chairs and table overlooking the ocean staff brought welcome drinks and cold towels to the room  a lovely touch a welcome amenity of fresh fruit was ready and waiting too as it is a relatively newish hotel everything is in good condition no complaints room wiseswimming in the ocean we were stung by perhaps jelly fish  i cant be sure they were jelly fish but nonetheless my wife and i had to retreat from the water needless to say we didnt venture back in be aware if you do go swimming thereas cocotinos is a small resort there is only  restaurant which is fine breakfast was usually a la carte and reasonably good however many items on the menu for dinner were average at best which i think is not acceptable given the remoteness of the resort and the fact that guests must dine in the hotel  there are no other dining options my wife i and a friend who stayed at the resort all came to the same conclusion  the food was a bit dissapointing i hope the owners andor management will address this as other reviews here on tripadvisor have also noted even though occupancy was low instead of the usual menu why not offer a bbq for the guests something a little more rousingall staff at the resort were keen and eager at all times no complaints with the staffi do recommend cocotinos for anyone who would like to escape the ratrace and enjoy an idyllic boutique resort located on the beach i just hope some improvements are made regarding the dining experience for the guest,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
4.0,we only stayed for one night as we were continuing our journey the next day looking back we should have just stayed at cocotinos the hotel is beautifullydesigned on a small relaxed beach in southwest lombok after an hours drive from the airport we were thrilled to see our wellequipped room with gorgeous wooden furniture and accents the cute patio area and the outdoor shower the bed was very comfortable and all of the linens were of good quality the beach is small and pebbly but there are chairs provided and the pool looked quite nice we only ate breakfast during our stay but we were really pleased with the large servings and good quality the prices for other food items seemed a bit high as were the prices for excursions and spa services but if you are looking to relax in an undeveloped part of lombok cocotinos is an excellent choice,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
3.0,me  my friends were driving by the sekotong area when we found this hotel the area is nice and clean the rooms are beautiful and comfortable but my favorite is the tranquility perfect to let go of your stress and relax the whole day the beach is nice and clean the food is so so but the staffs are very friendly and the beach is very beautiful the biggest let down is that theres no fresh water availablethis place is far away from the city but im okay with that since its exactly what we were looking for however if you are planning to go to places like sade sukarare village senggigi or pearl farm you might need to consider to stay in other areas,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,just departed from cocotinos two days agoand only complaint that i have was too short a stay if i would known how nice and how beautiful the resort was i would have extended for few more days if you are looking for a relaxing stay with wonderful staff that cannot do enough for you then you must book cocotinos get away from the noise and the crowds of the gilis up north and sit back and relax at cocotinos i dont usually post on trip advisor coz i think the very few negative comments disturb me maybe these guests are not happy with themselves i only met happy guests at this resort and the excellent management and friendly staff made me feel right at home i cant wait to return later in the year and book with mosley at dive shop these guys do a excellent job thanks everyone at cocotinos for a truly relaxing experience in lombokfrank l vogt iiiusa,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
1.0,just couldnt get any sleep with noise breakfast selecction ran out early pretty expensive for what it is the location seems pretty far from anything touristy front office seemed understandign of our problems but couldnt solve anything i wish i had booked a place thats bit more established or part of chain but some boutiquey things just dont work out i guess,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
2.0,stayed there one night last week and checked out next morning no fresh water very bad food extreeeemely slow service though staffs were genuinely friendly aircon in room did not work properly when asked to talk to manager was told he was not present when in fact the man was sitting in the restaurant when we found out and complaint he was defensive argued and walked away total lack of professionalism as we drove out we saw some illegal gold mining activities and suspected they were the reason why this resort could not get fresh water,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,i booked this resort with relaxation in mind and it played out in spades the rooms are beautiful spotless and well decorated the high ceilings fan and ac all make for a very comfortable stay my wife especially like the indooroutdoor shower and the turndown service with fresh towels is very important at a beach resort the grounds of the cocotinos are perfectly manicured and gorgeous the pool is very nice and close to the restaurant which is right on the beach the restaurant prices are a little high but overall decent value the staff are not as quick to smile as you might find other staff to be ion other islands but this is part of the culture on lombok and you will find that the entire staff go out of their way to make the guests feel happy they even arranged a beautiful surprise for my father on his birthday by giving us a cake and the whole staff came out to sing happy birthday they even presented him with a bintang beer mug i imagine it was an easy choice after seeing him drink a few for the last couple of days  overall i would say that this is a great relaxed resort with so much natural beauty and such helpful staff you will not want to leave,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
4.0,we stayed in one of the beachside villas definitely worthwhile splurging because the other rooms dont offer the same views the villa was huge with lovely indoor and outdoor bathrooms and the deck with plunge pool was gorgeous having a big drinking water container in the room is a great extra and the hotel information provided in the room is very detailed and usefulalthough beachfront villa  is beautiful its right next to the pool and while we were there there were a lot of kids playing  and screaming   at the pool which was not quite the relaxing ambience we were hoping for i recommend requesting either of the other two villas if you want more privacy and peace in contrast to the villas we found the pool and restaurant areas a little functionalmost of the staff were friendly and attentivewifi is only available at the restaurant  reception area it was a bit flaky and we were sometimes unable to connect though the hotel has a couple of computers you can use would be good if wifi could be provided reliably throughout the hotel,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
3.0,to start off with the goodthe grounds are well kept and the entry way from the road is pretty impressivethe rooms were cleaned wellthe breakfast buffet was not the best ive had but it is good at the pricethe views from the restaurant are goodthe price is theoretically pretty goodfree premium channels on the tv were a good touchnow the badour city tour promised us four stops the driver only wanted to take us to a pretty dismal mall and when pushed to take us to one further destination left us alone to be swindled by some local guides he spoke very little english and was clearly not interested in guiding usthis tour cost  and i thought i should get back at least half the cost but the hotel was only interested in discounting this by  the money isnt a big issue but i thought the right gesture would have been to take the whole amount offno compensation for not having the twin beds as we booked and they promised us to bring a cot which never materialised the room was number  with the septic smellthey never gave us keys we didnt realise until the morning as we stayed put from coming back from the city tour until checking outit is impossible to alter or amend the booking without cancelling the booking by which time they may have taken the nonrefundable deposit so i was stuck with two nights when i really only wanted one nightthere were some workmencraftsmen working near the poolside early morning banging away on branches and playing audible radio music not a problem for me as i was awake but i imagine those who were sleeping could have been disturbedfront desk staff seemed a bit disinterested the restaurant staff were very engaged on the other hand and were sometimes noncommunicativedespite being a resort hotel by the beach none of the boats were available for hire due to cleaning perfectly understandable to maintain your boats but it seems pretty odd to take them all out of commission on a single dayall in all not bad value for the cost if you never have to shorten your stay that is if you want to stay fewer nights than you originally booked tough luck but the decent value for money is hugely marred by pretty bad service on many many fronts it could be quite good if they tightened up on service standards,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
3.0,downsides  restaurant food is about average breakfast is pretty poor in comparison to some of the others we stayed at stayed at jeeva klui parents stayed at room  dont recommend it as its by the septic tank and therefore smells also you have to eat at the hotels restaurants as its so far away from anythingupside  staff are very nice pool and location right on the beach was lovely sea was very clear they take you on their speed boat to gilli nannggu for idr this island i thoroughly recommend as its really idyllic plus the water is so clear and good for snorkelling i have heard the beach here is much better than gilli t etc but i cant comment as i have not been to those islands our villa which has two room s and plunge pool was lovely so was the spa the lady there did me a good deal on the treatments and she was really good too,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
4.0,the rooms very nice everything worked fine and very importantly the bathrooms very clean the restaurant and loby good service and good food great location and beautiful beaches so little tourist not crowded very quiet and peacefulwe loved the place we highly recommend it,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,my job takes me to many busy cities londonsydney ho chi minh city etc for the past two year i have been thinking of a break away from all this hustle and bustle i needed time out to recuperate the air asia promotion to lombok was most opportune the journey in from the airport already set the mood to relax with the slow pace of the countryside and the rustic scenery i did not bother to unpack on arrival it was so nice to feel the breeze and soak in the sun and feel the sand under my bare feet under a leafy tree was i dreaming no it was real  this is it total rest and relaxation i could expect for the next few days i really liked the room this is real cottage living with natural materials used creatively to blend in with brickwork giving the cottages a solid quality feel surrounded by a lush garden which is well maintained space is more than ample in the room with modern facilities for comfort the bed is huge and offers a good nights rest the outdoor bath takes the top prize for taking you close to the elements everyday i used it more than once the resort staff kept the room clean and fresh with a change of towels etcthe food  wow the highlight of my trip i love food and the resort did not disappoint the breakfast was generous and came with a selection of homemade jam and homemade bread in semibuffet style hot selections were also freshly prepared on order the menu offered a good mix of western and asian choices the is good but i would have preferred some of the local dishes to be more spicy they obviously had to tone down the spices to cater to european and american tastesi loved the jetty that jutted out into the sea the end of which gave a good view of the resort bay and the surrounding islands the boat trip to the islands was a real treat to the senses what incredible hues of blue and greens against the white sand walking barefoot on one island was exhilarating and calming at the same time i had the chance to ponder on the wonders of the sea there was absolutely no need to go shopping or sight seeing away from the resort i could fully relax in the resort and surrender myself to the spa what more could i ask for,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,although i am from japan i was lucky to be on project stationed in kl and because air asia now flying to lombok direct  so convenient access also new airport in lombok very good facility on arrival hotel guy display my name pick up very friendly journey to hotel a bit long but scenery interesting and you forget the distance the soft landscape in the resort is very beautiful and hotel supply own bananas for guests service very warm and welcoming indonesian styleonce i step into the resort whole person feel very relaxed from the restaurant i can see the ocean with little islands in front and in the horizon big ferries from bali to lombok back and forth it is a great and relaxing scene and it give me nice feeling of being in quiet place but still close to bali with all attractions design of buildings is contemporary vernacular tropical style i like use of local available material  local technology to achieve the mood in the rooms the place is very clean and this is very important to methe food is good but i suggest should use more fresh seafood and cook in front of the guests of course if can do sashimi and sushi even better because have fresh fish but i know this not easy skill to have maybe resort should employ japanese chef to train them for a few months to use local fish but cook japanese style then more japanese will come to resort white sand beach is pleasant and i like the jetty a lot because can see fish and corals at end of jetty i stayed only three nights not enough time to enjoy the island of lombok will come again with friends and stay longer,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,i have been very busy and stressed with months of overtime in the office and so i thought why not choose a quiet place to chill out the resort was a very pleasant surprise so nice and peaceful in its own private beach away from the usual busy tourist traps that nowadays you find in so many popular places such as bali and phuket ok i love bali also but if you have been there recently you will know how bad the traffic is what a relief then it was to find lombok so unspoiled by comparison  no traffic jams the rooms are beautiful and well decorated and spacious with high ceilings with aircon and fan the bathrooms have very nice details and provisions for us the staff was fantastic so friendly and warm i was surprised they planted banana trees among the old coconut trees but it works together with the flowering plants the place feels so cosy and looks so charming like someones lovinglycaredfor private garden the food was tasty and a good mix of asian and western i complimented the chef who would try to make any special request that we had the prices were not cheap but reasonable and comparable to hotels and resorts on the island and elsewhere i suppose i cannot expect to pay warung price in a nice resort i was told the bananas we ate came from the trees in the resort i went on a boat ride and the islands were like little jewels floating in the blue sea still looking pristine and untainted the snorkelling is excellent and highly recommendedthe resort is basically by itself without any bars or discos or restaurants nearby the resort is also located away from the villages which means less noise except for the occasional wayward motorbike with the big exhaust so it was ideal for me as i was tired of the hustle and bustle of the big city and really needed a good rest and i got it especially after a couple of visits to the spa on the beach although i stayed in a garden room i was shown the villas on the beach front and they looked really inviting especially the rinjani villa which has an upper deck with a newly added loft sitting area next to the bed and whirl pool  wow really cool i will definitely be backed and next time i would like to try out one of those villas with private pool,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,made our booking based on reviews and photos of the resort we we not disapointed the gardens around the vilas were beautiful and very well maintained they had the best beach of any that we visited to collect sea shells and im guessing that the snorling and scuba diving would also be incredable if your looking for a nice place to totaly get away from everything this would be the place one dissapointment was that there was only wifi free though in the restaraunt the food here was very good and in our short stay of  night we were unable to find a dish that we did not like i saw a few single people her and i sincerly hope they were looking for solitude as this was all i think they would of found so i am saying this is not the place to come if your looking to go out and meet people if i were staying here for an extended period i would suggest one of the ocean view rooms all the tap water is a slightly salty brine but there was always an ampel supply of fresh water mineral avalible in our room for washing face brushing teeth making tea or coffee ect,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
5.0,we arrived in cocotinos without having booked it was low season and we got a great deal from the manager we stayed in one of the superior rooms with beach view for only half of the normal walkin price during our stay the staff did everything to make us happy and with success cocotinos is located on a beautiful white sand beach ocean is lovely but we had an encounter with some jellyfish and the rooms are very well decorated and comfortable with indoor and outdoor showers a veranda with big chairs and lots of little extras incent sticks on balcony and chocolate on pillow at night the breakfast is good too the only negative point is the food at night we were not impressed with the quality of the fish and the way it was prepared the spa is recommended one of the best massages during my holidays in bali and lombok with a soothing ocean breeze,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
4.0,cocotinos is in the south west of lombok an area with very little development in which you will see few tourists we stayed in a garden room which was spacious and beautifully designed the water front villas looked amazing the whole place is spotlessly clean and the scenery stunning a major draw and the main reason we chose to stay there is gili nanggu just  minutes away by boat ride which the hotel provide for a fee this is among the most beautiful places we have ever been and the snorkelling is something else  you almost dont need a snorkel especially if you take some bread with to attract the fish the hotel will also rent you a snorkel though this seemed a bit stingy compared with other resorts where they will lend them for free eg jeeva kluigili nanggu should not be missed  we went several times it is a beautiful and quiet island just to wonder around as well as for the snorkelling on one of the three days we went a few tour boats were there on other days there was hardly anyone therea word of warning  the management of gili nanggu do not want food from outside the island to be taken in understandably since they have their own hotel and restaurant though cocotinos will make a sandwich packed lunch for you if you are out for the day it hasntbeen very well thought through and is basically just the lunchtime sandwich option including a dressed salad and chips put into a boxyou can also walk round several beaches to the left from the hotel where you will not see a soul wear sandals in the sea as there are black spiky urchinsthe hotel is quite new and the extremely friendly staff still do not provide quite the level of service you would expect at a luxury resort we were among a very small number of guests staying during our visit and sometimes food in the restaurant on the whole very goodtook a long time to arrive one cocktail we ordered was definitely not up to scratch but to the hotels credit they replaced it breakfast was slightly underwhelming  they were not running the buffet due to low occupancy and inexplicably there was no fresh juice only squash thebreakfast menu also looks a bit limited in which options you are allowed to select but after the first day we queried this and they let us order what we liked complementary afternoon tea was a nice touchthere was some road noise because a road goes right by the resort but it is not a very busy road so it didnt bother us too much though i probably wouldnt stay in the back row of rooms for this reasonthe spa  i had a massage that was disappointing  the spa area is very nice but the masseuse lacked abilityoverall we had a really great time and would definitely recommend this hotel and this area to anyone visiting lombok,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

5.0,to give myself a break after a frenzied week i decided to go to lombok and visit the cocotinos sekotong boutique beach resort for a restful weekend i was there last year and had good memories from that new resort and was wondering how it was doing now arriving on a garuda flight i was impressed with the new airport using sky bridges docking at the terminal because it is not used to capacity yet with many empty spaces the interior could have a bit more color and sparkle as a welcome after all you arrive at a beautiful exotic tropical island which deserves better than a dreary monotonous lookarriving at the resort i was pleasantly surprised with the changes since my last visit a matured landscaping and a delightful semi permanent extension of the restaurant giving the feeling of sitting right on the beach enjoying the sound of the surf there were also more items on the menu now and i was delighted to see the cooks daring to move out to the restaurant to cook for your breakfast besides the buffet as a notorious bread eater i enjoyed the wholewheat varieties oh yes i was flattered that the staff that recognized me from the last visit and recalled my angriness of getting my fresh juice with sugar although it was my fault not telling them so now they were asking to make sure it was right as i just wanted a rest i did not go snorkeling although the weather was perfect nor did i venture out on a biking tour on the brand new bikes or trying out the new kayaks the room and spacious bathroom were spotless and i enjoyed the little touches especially the local delicacies brought to your room as an afternoonsnack yes great resort commendable for couples and families who look for a quiet place away from the crowds of the,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
4.0,i stayed at cocotinos for just one night whilst i was on a business trip in the area its an excellently presented hotel but i did find some aspects of my room a little unclean cobwebs built up in areas etc all in all though it is really very pleasant the restaurant is excellent with a great selection of western and indonesian food and exceptionally good service all round will definitely come back but next time with my family,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban

3.0,this is definitely a couples or family resort its quite out of the way about  hours from the airport i managed to get a cab from the airport for  idraround aud its a very quiet resort and the staff are very accommodating there is not much around the resort and you will tire of the menu at the restaurant very quickly the prices for food and drinks are quite high for indonesia the setting is beautiful but unfortunately due to ocean currents a lot of rubbish ends up in the water surrounding the resort so we stuck mostly to the pool also i didnt get g reception on my indonesian sim while there and the internet was down a the resort the entire time which was quite inconvenient as i had work to do that being said its a lovely place to spend a few days just relaxing,"Cocotinos Sekotong, Boutique Beach Resort & Spa",NTB,Urban
