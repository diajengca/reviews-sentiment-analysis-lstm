# Tourism Reviews Sentiment Analysis using Long Short Term Memory

The goal of this project is to do sentiment analysis to tourism reviews. The sentiment analysis is done on aspect level, so we tried to predict if the review is containing the aspects or not and what is the sentiment.

We used NLTK to do the stop words removal, and then SnowballStemmer to do the stemming, and Keras Tensorflow Tokenizer to do the tokenizing. To predict, we used Keras Tensorflow using Long Short Term Memory algorithm.
